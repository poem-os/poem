# Pre-Implementation KDD Checklist

Quick pattern validation before starting implementation.

## Pattern Discovery (6 items)

- [ ] Check `docs/kdd/patterns/` for established patterns
- [ ] Review `docs/examples/` for similar implementations
- [ ] Validate approach aligns with established patterns
- [ ] Identify potential new patterns that may emerge
- [ ] Plan what examples should be created
- [ ] Document any necessary deviations with justification

**Executed By**: Dev Agent (during story startup, before implementation)
**Time Required**: 5-10 minutes
**Purpose**: Ensure alignment with institutional knowledge before coding
