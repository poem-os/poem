## Validation Methodology

### Signature-Based Pattern Matching

**Approach**: Keyword-based signature similarity (no AI/embeddings)

**Signature Components**:
1. **Error Keywords** (40% weight) - Error types, symptoms, failure modes
   - Examples: "error", "validation", "parse", "override", "mismatch"
2. **Affected Components** (40% weight) - Domain areas, system components
   - Examples: "api", "schema", "test", "template", "workflow", "helper"
3. **Technology Stack** (20% weight) - Languages, frameworks, tools
   - Examples: "typescript", "vitest", "handlebars", "faker", "astro"

**Similarity Computation**:
- **Weighted Average**: (40% keywords + 40% components + 20% tech)
- **Threshold**: 60% signature match triggers recurrence detection (VAL-006 rule)
- **Jaccard Index**: `Similarity = |Intersection| / |Union| × 100`

**Recurrence Classification**:
| Occurrences | Classification | Recommended Action |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 story | Single Issue | Keep as learning, monitor |
| 2 stories | Monitored Issue | Watch for third occurrence |
| 3+ stories | **Pattern Promotion Candidate** | Create reusable pattern |

### Recurrence Analysis by Category

#### 🟢 Single Occurrences: 10 learnings (100%)

All 10 learnings document **unique issues** with no recurrence detected:

**Epic 0-2 Learnings** (Foundational):
- **hot-reload-production-mode.md** - POEM_DEV environment variable behavior
- **slash-command-source-duplication.md** - Agent definition redundancy management

**Epic 3 Learnings** (Architecture):
- **architecture-validation-failure-story-3-7.md** - Dual-file schema deviation from unified design
- **test-expectation-maintenance.md** - Workflow changes breaking test expectations
- **discovery-mode-pattern-emergence.md** - Organic pattern emergence from dev behavior
- **workflow-persistence-edge-cases.md** - File-based state persistence edge cases

**Epic 4 Learnings** (Implementation):
- **epic4-array-type-override-bug.md** - Pattern detection overriding array types
- **epic4-integration-tests-deferred-to-sat.md** - Server startup overhead in integration tests
- **epic4-section-naming-pattern-emergence.md** - Section-based naming from real-world usage
- **epic4-helper-metadata-api-discovery.md** - Need for helper API endpoint

**Analysis**: Each learning addresses a **distinct problem domain**:
- Environment configuration (hot-reload, production mode)
- Architecture alignment (schema structure, validation)
- Testing strategies (expectations, integration timing)
- Pattern emergence (discovery mode, section naming)
- Type safety (array overrides)
- API design (helper metadata)

---

#### 🟡 Monitored Issues (2 occurrences): 0

**No issues appearing in 2 stories** - No emerging patterns to monitor.

---

#### 🔴 Pattern Promotion Candidates (3+ occurrences): 0

**No issues appearing in 3+ stories** - No patterns eligible for promotion.

**Promotion Threshold**: 3+ story occurrences (evidence-based from SupportSignal analysis)
**Current Candidates**: None

## Why Zero Recurrence?

### Contributing Factors

1. **Strong Architecture Foundation (Epic 3)**
   - Epic 3 established robust patterns that prevent recurring issues
   - 5 core patterns documented: Config Service, Unified Schemas, API-First, Skills Format, Workflow-Scoped Resources
   - 4 ADRs locked in architectural decisions

2. **Effective Knowledge Capture**
   - Learnings captured during development, not after-the-fact
   - Dev Agent Record debugging notes extracted to learnings
   - QA feedback incorporated into learnings

3. **Pattern-Driven Development**
   - Epic 4 leveraged Epic 3 patterns successfully
   - No architectural deviations in Epic 4 (unlike Story 3.7 in Epic 3)
   - Patterns referenced during implementation (self-checking)

4. **Domain Diversity**
   - Each story tackles different technical challenges
   - Epic 3: Architecture (schemas, workflows, APIs)
   - Epic 4: Implementation (mock data, helpers, persistence, chaining)
   - No repeated problem domains

5. **Effective QA Process**
   - Quinn's comprehensive reviews catch issues before they recur
   - Risk assessments identify potential recurring issues proactively
   - Test design prevents regression

---

## Pattern Promotion History (Existing)

While no new pattern promotion candidates were detected, **several patterns were already promoted from learnings during Epic 3-4**:

### Epic 3 Promotions

1. **Discovery Mode Pattern** (from learning: discovery-mode-pattern-emergence.md)
   - Emerged from Story 3.2.9 observation
   - Formalized as repeatable workflow pattern

### Epic 4 Promotions

2. **Section-Based Template Naming** (from learning: epic4-section-naming-pattern-emergence.md)
   - Emerged from YouTube workflow with 53 templates
   - Promoted to pattern in Story 4.1

3. **Helper Metadata API** (from learning: epic4-helper-metadata-api-discovery.md)
   - Emerged from agent discovery needs in Story 4.4
   - Extended API-First pattern to all discoverable resources

**Observation**: Pattern promotion happening **proactively during epics**, not reactively after 3+ occurrences. This prevents recurrence rather than detecting it.

## Recurrence Trends

### Historical Trend Analysis

| Epic | Learnings Created | Recurring Issues | Recurrence Rate |
|------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Epic 0-2 | 2 | 0 | 0% |
| Epic 3 | 4 | 0 | 0% |
| Epic 4 | 4 | 0 | 0% |
| **Total** | **10** | **0** | **0%** |

**Trend**: 🟢 **Stable** - Zero recurrence maintained across all epics

**Interpretation**:
- Epic 3 established strong architectural foundation
- Epic 4 leveraged patterns successfully without recurring issues
- Proactive pattern promotion prevents issues from recurring

---

## Comparison to Baseline

| Metric | SupportSignal Baseline | POEM Current | Improvement |
|--------|------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Recurrence Detection | 0% (no tracking) | **0% issues recurring** | ✅ **N/A (no baseline)** |
| Pattern Promotion | Manual/reactive | Proactive (during epic) | ✅ **Proactive** |
| Recurring Issues | Unknown | **0 detected** | ✅ **Excellent** |

**Evidence Source**: SupportSignal had no formal recurrence detection (VAL-006 baseline: 0%). POEM establishes tracking from Day 1.

---

## Recommendations Summary

### High Priority (Critical)
**None** - No recurring issues detected. ✅

### Medium Priority (Enhancement)
**None** - Recurrence rate is 0%, no patterns need promotion. ✅

### Low Priority (Monitoring)

1. **Continue Proactive Pattern Promotion**
   - Current approach (promote during epic) prevents recurrence effectively
   - Continue extracting patterns from learnings when appropriate
   - Don't wait for 3+ occurrences if pattern is clearly reusable

2. **Run *detect-recurrence Periodically**
   - After each epic (5-10 stories completed)
   - Monthly topology health checks
   - Validates that proactive approach is working

3. **Track Pattern Effectiveness**
   - Monitor whether Epic 3 patterns prevent issues in Epic 5+
   - If patterns are violated, capture as learnings and check for recurrence
   - Validate that patterns are being referenced (James self-check, Quinn enforcement)
