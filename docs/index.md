## Stories

**Location**: [stories/](./stories/)

Current epic: Epic 3 (Prompt Engineering)

**Stories Completed**: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
**Stories In Progress**: 3.4
**Stories Pending**: 3.5

Each story includes:
- Story description and acceptance criteria
- Dev agent record
- QA results
- SAT (System Acceptance Testing) file

---

## Guides

**Location**: [guides/](./guides/)

### Capability Progression Validation

**[Workflow Validation Guide](./guides/workflow-validation-guide.md)** - Complete guide for using Victor (Workflow Validator agent)

**What**: Product-level QA that validates capabilities across stories, not just in isolation

**When to use**: After story completion, before merge

**Agent**: `/poem/agents/victor`

---

## Planning (Historical)

**Location**: [planning/](./planning/)

**Note**: Pre-BMAD brainstorming and exploration. Reference only.

**System Explorations** (5 files):
- Mapping framework
- Mapping system design
- Prompt engineer
- Skills system

**Decisions** (open questions):
- Handlebars vs templating
- Schema alternatives
- Data dictionary patterns

**Reference Materials**:
- BMAD methodology
- SupportSignal examples

---

## Future Enhancements

**[future-enhancements.md](./future-enhancements.md)** - High-visibility tracking for future work

**Highlights**:
- 🎯 **Epic 8**: BMAD Integration - Capability Validation Pattern (requirements complete!)
- Automated regression testing
- Visual progress dashboards
- Multi-dataset validation
- AI-powered failure analysis

---

## BMAD Integration

**Location**: [planning/bmad-integration/](./planning/bmad-integration/)

**[Capability Validation Requirements](./planning/bmad-integration/capability-validation-requirements.md)** - Requirements for generalizing POEM's workflow validation pattern to BMAD core

**Status**: 📋 Requirements Complete, Proof of Concept Validated
**Target**: BMAD v5.0.0 (Q2 2026)
**Effort**: 32-46 hours (4-6 full days)

**Applicable To**: Klueless, appydave-tools, BMAD itself, any framework/tooling project

---

## QA Assessments & Gates

**Location**: [qa/](./qa/)
- Quality assessments
- Gate decisions

---

## Data & Examples

**Location**: [data/](../data/)
- SupportSignal examples
- Storyline examples
- YouTube Launch Optimizer (54 prompts)

---

## Development Workspace

**Location**: `dev-workspace/` (gitignored, transient)

**Purpose**: User-generated content and validation artifacts during development

**Contains**:
- Test prompts, schemas, mock data
- Validation reports and snapshots (Victor agent)
- Integration matrix
- Feedback log

**See**: `dev-workspace/README.md` (regenerated by `./scripts/dev-setup.sh`)

**Documentation**: All guides and docs are in `docs/` (permanent), not `dev-workspace/` (transient)
