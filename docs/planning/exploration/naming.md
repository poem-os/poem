## The Name Journey

**Final Decision**: **POEM** - Prompt Orchestration and Engineering Method

**Why This Works**:

- ✅ Visually striking in capital letters (POEM)
- ✅ Correctly spelled word (searchable, memorable, findable in videos/articles)
- ✅ Short and punchy (4 letters)
- ✅ Sentence built first, acronym emerged naturally (vs forced acronym → sentence)
- ✅ NPM package `poem-os` is AVAILABLE

**The Quirks**:

- ⚠️ "Orchestration" before "Engineering" feels backward grammatically
  - "Prompt Engineering Orchestration Method" would read better
  - But PEOM doesn't spell a word
- ⚠️ Has nothing to do with poetry (potential confusion)
- ⚠️ Word order prioritizes memorability over grammatical accuracy

**Design Philosophy**: Sentence → Acronym (not Acronym → Sentence)

- Built the concept: "Prompt Orchestration and Engineering Method"
- Discovered it spelled POEM
- Accepted the quirks for the visual/memorable payoff

## Comparison to BMAD

**BMAD** = Breakthrough Method for Agile AI Driven Development

- Acronym feels forced to fit "BMAD"
- Harder to remember the full name
- Not a correctly spelled word

**POEM** = Prompt Orchestration and Engineering Method

- Natural word
- Easier to remember and reference
- Visually distinctive

## Alternative Names Considered

### Operating System Angle

- **PEOS** - Prompt Engineering Operating System (accurate but generic)
- **PEM** - Prompt Engineering Method (simple but loses OS concept)
- **PROMPT** - Prompt Runtime for Orchestration, Mapping, and Production Testing (recursive/meta, but forced)

### Mock Data + Testing Focus

- **FORGE** - Framework for Orchestrating, Refining, and Generating Examples (strong verb, captures mock data generation)
- **MINT** - Mock data Integration and Narrative Testing (clean but too simple)
- **CAST** - Contextual Assembly and Simulation Tool (good for storytelling, too specific)

### Workspace/Environment Angle

- **STUDIO** - System for Testing, Understanding, and Deploying Intelligence Operations (too forced)
- **BENCH** - Prompt Engineering Bench (not an acronym, but captures workspace feel)

### Metaphorical Names

- **TRELLIS** - Template Refinement Environment with Live Logic and Iteration Support (beautiful metaphor, too long)
- **LOOM** - Logic Operations and Output Modeling (weaving metaphor, not clear)
- **KILN** - Testing/firing/hardening before production (strong metaphor, requires explanation)

### Variations on POEM

- **POEM** - Prompt Operating Engineering Machine (feels wrong)
- **POEM** - Prompt Operations Execution Method (loses orchestration concept)
- **POEM** - Prompt Optimization and Engineering Methodology (too long)

## Why We Kept POEM

**Visual Impact**: Even with quirks, the name is memorable and distinctive
**Findability**: Correctly spelled word means better discoverability
**Brevity**: 4-letter acronym is ideal for branding
**Uniqueness**: POEM doesn't exist as a prompt engineering system
**NPM Available**: `poem-os` organization and package name available

**Accepted Trade-offs**:

- Grammatical word order (Orchestration before Engineering)
- Poetry association (irrelevant but harmless)
- Not 100% literal/descriptive

**Philosophy**: Memorable > Grammatically Perfect

## Tagline

**Primary**: _"Poetry in Prompt Engineering"_

- Embraces the POEM name fully
- Suggests craft, artistry, refinement
- Simple and memorable
- Turns the poetry "quirk" into a feature

**Secondary**: _"Compose. Test. Refine. Deploy."_

- Workflow in 4 beats (like a stanza)
- Actionable and clear
- Maintains subtle poetry metaphor
- Describes the actual process

## Branding

**GitHub Organization**: `poem-os`
**Main Repository**: `poem-os/poem`
**NPM Package**: `poem-os`

**Installation**:

```bash
npx poem-os install           # Installs everything (.poem-core/ + .poem-app/)
npx poem-os install --core    # Just .poem-core/
npx poem-os install --app     # Just .poem-app/
```
