## Decision Status Log

| Decision                  | Status                           | File                               | Final Choice                                          | Date       | Notes                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Handlebars Templating** | ✅ **Decided**                   | `handlebars-templating.md`         | Use Handlebars (.hbs extension)                       | 2025-11-20 | All prompts use .hbs, strong rationale documented                                     |
| **Workflow Definition Format** | ✅ **Decided**              | `workflow-definition-format.md`    | YAML format for content workflows (Epic 4)            | 2026-01-07 | Sequential execution, auto-derived data bus                                           |
| **Agent Workflows vs BMAD** | ⚠️ **Divergent**               | `agent-workflows-vs-bmad-tasks.md` | Custom YAML (Epic 3), future alignment needed         | 2026-01-11 | Tracks divergence from BMAD v4 tasks, Epic 9 for resolution                          |
| **Schema Format**         | 📋 **Leaning**                   | `schema-format-alternatives.md`    | Custom JSON (open to Architect ideas)                 | -          | Simple approach preferred, but Architect can choose alternative                       |
| **Fourth Agent**          | 📋 **Decided Need, Details TBD** | `../system-explorations/agents.md` | Will have 4th agent (Data/Testing), specifics pending | -          | Mock data complexity suggests need, but implementation details require more discovery |
| **Mapping Architecture**  | 📋 **Deferred (YAGNI)**          | `mapping-architecture-concepts.md` | Build when needed                                     | 2025-11-20 | Don't over-engineer, implement if use cases emerge                                    |

## Decision Categories

### ✅ Decided

Choices that have been made and documented:

- **Handlebars Templating**: Using Handlebars for template engine
- **Workflow Definition Format**: YAML for content workflows (Epic 4)

### ⚠️ Divergent / Tracked for Alignment

Decisions that diverge from framework standards, tracked for future resolution:

- **Agent Workflows vs BMAD**: Custom YAML format (Epic 3) diverges from BMAD v4 markdown tasks - tracked in Epic 9

### 📋 Leaning / Pending

Preferences indicated, but open to BMAD specialist input:

- **Schema Format**: Leaning toward Custom JSON, but Architect should choose
- **Fourth Agent**: Decided we want one, details need more information

### 🔄 Deferred

Decisions postponed until more information available:

- **Mapping Architecture**: YAGNI - build when use cases emerge

---

## For BMAD Specialists

### Business Analyst

- Use decided items as constraints
- Note open questions for PRD
- Leaning items are suggestions, not requirements

### PRD Writer

- Document decided items as requirements
- Present alternatives for open decisions
- Include rationale from decision files

### Architect

- Respect decided items (unless strong rationale to change)
- Make final call on "leaning" items
- Question assumptions if needed
- Document your architectural decisions separately

## How to Use Decision Files

Each decision file includes:

1. **Current Status**: Exploring, Decided, Deferred
2. **Problem Statement**: What we're deciding
3. **Alternatives**: Options considered
4. **Rationale**: Why each option matters
5. **BMAD Ready**: Whether ready for handoff

---

## Adding New Decisions

When documenting a decision:

1. Create new file: `decision-name.md`
2. Follow template:

   ```markdown
   # Decision: [Name]

   **Status**: Exploring / Decided / Deferred
   **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
   **BMAD Ready**: Yes / No / Partial

   ## Problem

   [What are we deciding?]

   ## Alternatives

   ### Option 1: [Name]

   - Pros: ...
   - Cons: ...

   ### Option 2: [Name]

   - Pros: ...
   - Cons: ...

   ## Recommendation

   [If status is Decided]

   ## Rationale

   [Why this choice?]
   ```

3. Update this README decision log table
4. Reference in poem-requirements.md if critical
