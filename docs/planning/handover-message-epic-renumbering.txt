=== HANDOVER: Epic Renumbering Task ===

GOAL:
Insert new Epic 5 (Workflow Orchestration Agents) into POEM roadmap and shift existing Epics 5-9 down to become 6-10.

WHY:
We identified a critical gap: no conversational interface for creating/executing workflows. Epic 4.6 delivered the technical execution engine, but users can't create workflow YAMLs or run workflows with human-in-the-loop checkpoints through conversation.

Two new agents solve this:
- Alex (Workflow Architect): Designs and generates workflow YAML definitions
- Oscar (Workflow Orchestrator): Executes workflows with checkpoint-based human collaboration

TASK:
Renumber epic references in POEM documentation:
- Epic 5 (System Agent) → Epic 6
- Epic 6 (Integration Agent) → Epic 7
- Epic 7 (Mock Data Agent) → Epic 8
- Epic 8 (BMAD Integration) → Epic 9
- Epic 9 (Multi-Workflow Support) → Epic 10
- INSERT new Epic 5 (Workflow Orchestration Agents)

6. Any planning docs with epic references

EPIC 5 CONTENT SOURCE:
/Users/davidcruwys/dev/ad/poem-os/poem/docs/planning/epic-5-workflow-orchestration-agents.md

DETAILED HANDOVER DOC:
/Users/davidcruwys/dev/ad/poem-os/poem/docs/planning/handover-epic-renumbering.md
(Contains: search patterns, validation checklist, automation strategies, success criteria)

ESTIMATED EFFORT: 1-2 hours

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
1. Read the detailed handover doc first
2. Use search patterns to find all epic references
3. Work backwards (Epic 9→10, 8→9, 7→8, 6→7, 5→6) to avoid double-replacement
4. Extract Epic 5 summary from planning doc and insert into epic-list.md
5. Validate all changes before committing
6. Use git commit message from handover doc

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
- All epic numbers updated in PRD
- New Epic 5 content inserted
- Architecture docs updated
- No broken cross-references
- Git diff reviewed

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
Task complete when POEM documentation reflects new epic structure (6-10 instead of 5-9) with new Epic 5 inserted, all references updated, and changes committed.
