# KDD Decisions Index

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and significant technical decisions made during POEM development.

## Purpose

Decision documents capture:
- Significant technical choices
- Alternatives considered
- Trade-offs evaluated
- Rationale for chosen approach
- Consequences and implications

## Format

ADRs follow this structure:
- **Title**: Short descriptive name
- **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
- **Context**: Problem or situation requiring a decision
- **Decision**: What we decided to do
- **Alternatives Considered**: Options evaluated
- **Rationale**: Why this approach was chosen
- **Consequences**: Expected outcomes, trade-offs, risks

## Naming Convention

`adr-NNN-short-title.md` where NNN is a sequential number (e.g., `adr-001-unified-schema-structure.md`)
