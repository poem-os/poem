# KDD Patterns Index

This directory contains reusable code patterns and approaches that work well in the POEM codebase.

## Purpose

Patterns document:
- Architectural patterns established
- Code organization conventions
- Testing strategies
- Integration patterns
- Anti-patterns to avoid

## Format

Each pattern document should include:
- **Context**: When to use this pattern
- **Implementation**: How to implement it
- **Example**: Working code demonstrating the pattern
- **Rationale**: Why this approach was chosen
- **Related Patterns**: Cross-references to similar patterns

## Current Patterns

### Core Patterns

- [Handlebars Parsing Patterns](handlebars-parsing-patterns.md) - Template parsing and placeholder extraction

### Epic 3 Patterns (Prompt Engineering Agent Foundation)

*To be populated via KDD retrospective execution*

Expected patterns:
