# KDD Learnings Index

This directory contains insights and discoveries made during POEM development. Things we learned that weren't obvious from documentation or initial design.

## Purpose

Learnings capture:
- Unexpected behaviors discovered
- Root causes of bugs
- Performance characteristics
- Integration gotchas
- Assumption corrections

## Format

Each learning document should include:
- **Context**: What we were trying to do
- **Challenge**: What went wrong or surprised us
- **Solution**: How we addressed it
- **Outcome**: Results and validation
- **Future Application**: When to apply this learning

## Current Learnings

- [Slash Command Source Duplication](slash-command-source-duplication.md) - Managing agent definition redundancy
