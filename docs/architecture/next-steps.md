# Next Steps

## Architect Handoff to Scrum Master

```
The POEM Architecture document is complete and ready for story creation.

Key areas for Epic 1 (Foundation & Monorepo Setup):
- Monorepo structure with NPM workspaces
- packages/poem-core/ scaffolding (agents, workflows, skills directories)
- packages/poem-app/ Astro project initialization
- bin/install.js NPX installer
- Claude Code slash command integration

Reference this architecture document for:
- Project structure (Unified Project Structure section)
- Tech stack versions (Tech Stack section)
- API contracts (API Specification section)
- Coding standards (Coding Standards section)
- CI/CD approach (CI/CD Strategy section - start with manual checklist)

The architecture includes TypeScript interfaces for all data models and
OpenAPI spec for all API endpoints - use these as implementation contracts.
