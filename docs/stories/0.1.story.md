# Story 0.1: Work Intake Triage System

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** POEM developer,
**I want** a unified work intake triage system,
**so that** I can quickly route development work to the appropriate workflow without decision paralysis or confusion.

## Background

**Problem**: POEM has 5+ different entry points for development work (existing stories, new stories in epics, quick fixes, Epic 0 stories, usage issues), but no unified way to decide which path to take. Developers experience decision paralysis when they have work but aren't sure whether it should be a story, a quick fix, Epic 0, or which epic it belongs to.

**Current Pain Points**:
1. Only existing stories have a clear path (`/appydave-workflow {story}`)
2. New work requires manual decision-making about:
   - Is this <1hr (Quick Fixes) or >1hr (Story)?
   - Which epic does this fit? Or is it Epic 0?
   - Should I use Bob? Or just fix it directly?
3. Usage issues in `usage-issues.jsonl` have no conversion mechanism to stories/fixes
4. No clear criteria or decision tree documented

**Example from Recent Work**:
User wanted to create "README Enhancement System" for Epic 1. Had requirements in conversation but no clear path to:
- Decide if it's Epic 1 Story 1.10 vs Epic 0 Story 0.1
- Know whether to use Bob *draft or another command
- Convert conversation requirements into story format
- Kickstart AppyDave workflow

**Solution**: Create `/triage` skill that analyzes context (conversation, usage issues, explicit description), evaluates against decision criteria (time, epic fit, impact), and routes to the appropriate workflow with clear recommendations and handoff context.

**Epic 0 Category**: Developer Experience (P1)
**Priority**: P1 (High) - Reduces friction in daily development workflow

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Naming Cleanup: Rename Maintenance Backlog to Quick Fixes

- Rename file: `docs/backlog/maintenance.md` → `docs/backlog/quick-fixes.md`
- Update file header to "Quick Fixes" (not "Maintenance Backlog")
- Update `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`:
  - Change `maintenance.backlogFile` to `docs/backlog/quick-fixes.md`
- Update Bob's commands in `.bmad-core/agents/sm.md`:
  - `*add-fix {category} {description}` (was `*add-maint`)
  - `*list-fixes` (was `*list-maint`)
- Update Sarah's commands in `.bmad-core/agents/po.md` (same changes)
- Verify no naming collision with Epic 0 "Maintenance & Continuous Improvement"

### 2. Triage Task Creation (Core Logic)

Create `.bmad-core/tasks/triage-work.md` with:

**Decision Criteria** (evaluated in priority order):
1. **Time/Ceremony**: <1hr AND no ceremony needed → Quick Fix, else Story
2. **Epic Thematic Fit**: Installation/Foundation → Epic 1, Prompts → Epic 2, etc.
3. **Impact/Priority**: High impact justifies story-level tracking
4. **Type**: Bug/enhancement/refactor/docs helps determine Epic 0 vs Feature Epic

**Decision Tree Logic**:
```
Is it <1 hour AND no ceremony needed?
├─ Yes → Quick Fixes Backlog (*add-fix)
└─ No → Story required
    ├─ Fits feature epic theme? (Installation, Prompts, Workflows, etc.)
    │  └─ Yes → Feature Epic Story (Bob *draft in Epic N)
    └─ No clear epic fit OR pure maintenance?
       └─ Yes → Epic 0 Story (Bob *draft in Epic 0)
```

**Routing Paths**:
1. Path #1: Existing Story → `/appydave-workflow {story}`
2. Path #2: New Epic 1-7 Story → Bob `*draft` in epic → `/appydave-workflow`
3. Path #3: Quick Fixes → Bob `*add-fix` → Direct fix and log
4. Path #4: Epic 0 Story → Bob `*draft` in Epic 0 → `/appydave-workflow`
5. Path #5: From Usage Issue → Analyze issue → Route to appropriate path

**Context Analysis**:
- Read recent conversation (last 10-20 messages)
- Parse usage issues if `/triage issue-{N}` format used
- Extract: scope, area, time estimate, impact, type

**Output Format**:
```
🔍 Work Intake Triage
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Analyzing context...
✓ Found: [description]
✓ Area: [epic/category]
✓ Estimate: [time]
✓ Impact: [high/medium/low]
✓ Type: [bug/enhancement/refactor/docs]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📋 Routing Decision
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ RECOMMENDED: [Path Name]
   [Path details]
   Reason: [2-3 bullet points]

   Next: [Command to execute]

   Press Enter or type 'go' to proceed ⏎

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔀 Alternatives
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ [Alternative 1]
2️⃣ [Alternative 2]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Type 'go' for recommended path, '1' or '2' for alternatives,
or describe what you'd prefer: _
```

**Example Scenario** (Quick Fix):
```
User: /triage
User (earlier in conversation): "Need to fix typo in CONTRIBUTING.md line 45"

Triage Output:
✓ Found: Fix typo in CONTRIBUTING.md
✓ Area: Documentation
✓ Estimate: 5 minutes
✓ Impact: Low
✓ Type: docs

✅ RECOMMENDED: Quick Fixes (Path #3)
   Category: documentation
   Reason:
   - <1 hour scope (5 minutes)
   - Simple correction, no ceremony needed
   - Direct fix more efficient than story overhead

   Next: /BMad/agents/sm then *add-fix documentation "Fix typo in CONTRIBUTING.md"

   Press Enter or type 'go' to proceed ⏎

🔀 Alternatives:
1️⃣ Create Epic 0 Story (if you want formal tracking)
```

**Handoff Templates** for each path with context for receiving agent/workflow

**Agent Command Format Clarification**:
- Commands like "Bob *draft" mean: Load Bob via `/BMad/agents/sm`, THEN type `*draft`
- "Next: /BMad/agents/sm then *draft" = Two-step process
- Triage hands off the routing decision, user executes the command sequence

### 3. Skill Wrapper Creation

Create `.claude/commands/triage.md`:
- Top-level skill (NOT in `.claude/commands/poem/` - this is BMAD, not POEM)
- Thin wrapper that loads `.bmad-core/tasks/triage-work.md`
- Supports both `/triage` and `/triage issue-{N}` formats
- ~30-40 lines

### 4. Agent Integration

Update `.bmad-core/agents/sm.md` (Bob):
- Add `*triage` command to commands list
- Description: "Analyze work and route to appropriate workflow"
- References: `tasks/triage-work.md`

Update `.bmad-core/agents/po.md` (Sarah):
- Add `*triage` command to commands list
- Same description and reference

### 5. User Documentation

Create `docs/workflows/triage-guide.md`:
- When to use `/triage`
- Examples for each of the 5 paths
- Decision criteria explained
- Visual decision tree
- FAQ section
- ~150-200 lines

### 6. Usage Issue Integration

Triage task must handle `/triage issue-{N}` format:
- Read `docs/planning/gap-analysis/usage-issues.jsonl`
- Parse issue number
- Check if issue is open or resolved
- If open: analyze and route
- If resolved: inform user and offer to list open issues
- Support filtering by severity/category

### 7. Epic 0 PRD Clarification

Update `docs/prd/epic-0-process.md`:
- Ensure header says "Maintenance & Continuous Improvement"
- Add section clarifying boundary with Quick Fixes:
  ```markdown
  ### Quick Fixes vs Epic 0 Stories

  **Quick Fixes** (docs/backlog/quick-fixes.md):
  - <1 hour scope
  - No ceremony (no story file, no QA gate)
  - Direct fix and log with commit reference
  - Categories: infrastructure, tech-debt, documentation, bugs
  - Example: Fix typo in docs, add missing .gitignore entry

  **Epic 0 Stories**:
  - >1 hour scope
  - Full BMAD ceremony (5-agent AppyDave workflow)
  - Story file with acceptance criteria, tasks, QA review
  - Priority: P0 (Critical), P1 (High), P2 (Medium)
  - Example: Add triage system, refactor schema validation

  **Promotion**: Quick Fix grows beyond 1hr → promote to Epic 0 story
  ```

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Tech Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, lines 11-16]:
- **Framework Documents**: Markdown + YAML for agents, workflows, skills
- **Agent Definitions**: `.bmad-core/agents/*.md` with YAML frontmatter (line 12)
- **Task Definitions**: `.bmad-core/tasks/*.md` with step-by-step instructions
- **Skill Wrappers**: `.claude/commands/*.md` (top-level for BMAD, `/poem/` for POEM-specific)

**Project Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md, lines 1-28]:
- BMAD files live in `.bmad-core/` (installed) or `packages/poem-core/` (dev repo) - lines 7-10
- Skill wrappers live in `.claude/commands/` (top-level for cross-project skills) - line 22
- Documentation lives in `docs/` (workflows, planning, etc.)
- **CRITICAL**: Development work happens in `packages/` directories, NOT installed `.poem-core/` paths

**Naming Conventions** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md, lines 21-37]:
- **poem-core section** (lines 25-28):
  - Agent files: `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `prompt-engineer.md`)
  - Workflow files: `kebab-case.yaml`
  - Skill files: `kebab-case.md`
- **Documentation** (line 35):
  - All docs: `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `triage-guide.md`)

### Command Verification

**Both Bob (SM) and Sarah (PO) have maintenance commands**:
- Bob: `.bmad-core/agents/sm.md` lines 55-56
- Sarah: `.bmad-core/agents/po.md` lines 67-68

Both agents need command renaming from `*add-maint`/`*list-maint` → `*add-fix`/`*list-fixes`

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Why task + skill wrapper pattern?**
   - Task file (`.bmad-core/tasks/`) is source of truth (reusable by agents)
   - Skill wrapper (`.claude/commands/`) provides user-facing entry point
   - Multiple entry points, single source of truth

2. **Why top-level `.claude/commands/triage.md` not `/poem/`?**
   - Triage is about BMAD development workflow
   - POEM is the project being built with BMAD
   - `/poem/` directory is for POEM-specific features (Penny, Victor, log-issues)
   - Top-level is for general BMAD/development skills

3. **Why rename Maintenance Backlog to Quick Fixes?**
   - Avoids collision with Epic 0 "Maintenance & Continuous Improvement"
   - "Quick Fixes" clearly describes <1hr, no-ceremony work
   - Commands become clearer: `*add-fix` vs `*add-maint`

4. **Why include usage issue integration?**
   - Usage issues (`usage-issues.jsonl`) are already part of gap analysis workflow
   - Triage provides conversion mechanism: issue → routed work
   - Single entry point for all work types

5. **What is the agent command format in handoffs?**
   - Format: "Next: /BMad/agents/sm then *draft" means TWO-STEP process:
     1. User loads agent: `/BMad/agents/sm` (activates Bob)
     2. User types command: `*draft` (Bob executes create-next-story task)
   - Triage DOES NOT auto-execute - it routes and hands off
   - User confirms and executes the suggested command sequence

### File Locations

New files to create:
- `.bmad-core/tasks/triage-work.md` (task logic)
- `.claude/commands/triage.md` (skill wrapper)
- `docs/workflows/triage-guide.md` (user documentation)

Files to modify:
- `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (update backlogFile path)
- `.bmad-core/agents/sm.md` (add *triage command, rename *add-fix/*list-fixes)
- `.bmad-core/agents/po.md` (add *triage command, rename *add-fix/*list-fixes)
- `docs/prd/epic-0-process.md` (clarify boundary with Quick Fixes)

Files to rename:
- `docs/backlog/maintenance.md` → `docs/backlog/quick-fixes.md`

### Testing Strategy

Manual testing scenarios:
1. **README Enhancement**: `/triage` on conversation → Routes to Epic 1 Story 1.10
   - SUCCESS: Displays Epic 1 routing with story number suggestion
   - Handoff: `/BMad/agents/sm` then `*draft`
2. **Quick Fix**: "Fix typo in CONTRIBUTING.md" → Routes to Quick Fixes
   - SUCCESS: Displays Quick Fixes routing with category "documentation"
   - Handoff: `/BMad/agents/sm` then `*add-fix documentation "Fix typo in CONTRIBUTING.md"`
3. **Epic 0**: "Add gitleaks to CI" → Routes to Epic 0 Story
   - SUCCESS: Displays Epic 0 routing with P1 priority
   - Handoff: `/BMad/agents/sm` then `*draft` (Epic 0 context)
4. **Usage Issue**: `/triage issue-3` → Routes to Epic 4 Story
   - SUCCESS: Loads issue from JSONL, analyzes, routes to appropriate epic
   - Handoff: Depends on issue content
5. **Existing Story**: Story 1.9 exists → Routes to `/appydave-workflow 1.9`
   - SUCCESS: Detects existing story, routes directly to workflow
   - Handoff: `/appydave-workflow 1.9`
6. **Missing File**: `/triage issue-5` when usage-issues.jsonl doesn't exist
   - SUCCESS: Graceful fallback message, continues with conversation triage

Validation:
- Each path produces correct handoff format (agent load + command sequence)
- Recommendations are appropriate for context
- Alternatives make sense for the scenario
- Free-form user input handled gracefully
- Usage issue parsing works correctly (with missing file fallback)
- Example scenario matches actual output format
