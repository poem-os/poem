## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

[Source: Story 3.2.9 Dev Agent Record]

Story 3.2.9 documented comprehensive workflow architecture (~3,000 lines) including:
- YAML workflow format with sections and steps
- Auto-derived schema concept
- Sequential execution with data accumulation
- Checkpoint pattern for human-in-the-loop
- 6 real-world test prompts validated in dev-workspace

**Key Learnings:**
- Dev workspace separation pattern proven effective
- Path resolution must inherit from config service (single source of truth)
- Workflows should follow agent-interpreted execution model (not automated)
- Elicitation steps use BMAD patterns for user interaction

### Workflow Architecture

[Source: docs/architecture.md § Workflow Definition Structure]

**YAML Workflow Format:**
```yaml
id: workflow-id
name: Workflow Name
version: "1.0.0"
author: POEM Framework
lastUpdated: "YYYY-MM-DD"

pathResolution: config  # CRITICAL: Do not add paths: section

description: |
  Multi-line workflow description

fallback:
  onMissingInput: prompt-again
  onApiError: show-error-and-retry
  onFileConflict: warn-and-confirm

steps:
  - id: step-id
    name: Step Name
    type: elicit | action | output
    elicit: true  # For elicitation steps
    prompt: |
      Prompt text for user
    validation:
      required: true
      minLength: 10
    stores: variableName
    instruction: |
      Instructions for agent executing this step
```

**Step Types:**
- `elicit` - Gather user input (requires `elicit: true` and `prompt` field)
- `action` - Perform operation (API call, file creation, etc.)
- `output` - Display summary/completion message

**Sequential Execution Model:**
- Steps execute in order (no parallel execution in Epic 3)
- Each step reads from accumulated workflow-data
- Each step writes outputs to workflow-data
- Progressive accumulation pattern

### Path Resolution Pattern

[Source: packages/poem-core/workflows/new-prompt.yaml]

**CRITICAL: Config Service as Source of Truth**

DO NOT add a `paths:` section to workflow YAML. Path resolution is inherited from `packages/poem-core/poem-core-config.yaml`:

```yaml
# WRONG - Don't do this
paths:
  development:
    prompts: dev-workspace/prompts

# CORRECT - Use pathResolution field
pathResolution: config
```

**Detection Logic:**
- Agent detects mode by checking for `packages/poem-core/` (dev) vs `.poem-core/` (prod)
- Development mode: `dev-workspace/prompts/`, `dev-workspace/schemas/`, `dev-workspace/mock-data/`
- Production mode: `poem/prompts/`, `poem/schemas/`, `poem/mock-data/`

**Workflow Header Comment:**
```yaml
# Refine Prompt Workflow
# Updates existing prompt template with iterative refinement
#
# Executed by: Prompt Engineer agent (Penny) via *refine command
# Execution model: Agent-interpreted (steps guide agent behavior, not automated)
#
# Path resolution: Inherited from poem-core-config.yaml
# DO NOT add a paths: section - config service is the source of truth
# See: packages/poem-core/workflows/README.md for the pattern
```

### API Endpoints

[Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**Render API:**
- Endpoint: `POST /api/prompt/render`
- Request: `{ template: string | path, data: object, isRawTemplate: boolean }`
- Response: `{ rendered: string, renderTimeMs: number, warnings: string[] }`
- Location: `packages/poem-app/src/pages/api/prompt/render.ts`

**Schema Extraction API:**
- Endpoint: `POST /api/schema/extract`
- Request: `{ template: string, isRawTemplate: boolean }`
- Response: `{ schema: object, fields: string[] }`
- Location: `packages/poem-app/src/pages/api/schema/extract.ts`

### File Locations and Naming

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Workflow File:**
- Location: `packages/poem-core/workflows/refine-prompt.yaml`
- Naming: kebab-case
- Becomes `.poem-core/workflows/refine-prompt.yaml` when installed

**Prompt Templates:**
- User workspace: `{workspace}/prompts/{prompt-name}.hbs`
- Naming: kebab-case.hbs

**Schemas:**
- User workspace: `{workspace}/schemas/{prompt-name}.json`
- Naming: kebab-case.json

**Mock Data:**
- User workspace: `{workspace}/mock-data/{prompt-name}.json`
- Naming: kebab-case.json

**Backup Files (if implementing iteration history):**
- Location: `{workspace}/prompts/backups/{prompt-name}.{timestamp}.bak`
- Timestamp format: `YYYYMMDD-HHmmss`

### Elicitation Pattern

[Source: packages/poem-core/workflows/new-prompt.yaml § Step 1-3]

**BMAD Elicitation Steps:**
```yaml
- id: step-id
  name: Step Name
  type: elicit
  elicit: true
  prompt: |
    Clear question or instruction for user.

    **Format guidance or examples**

    ---
    User input prompt:
  validation:
    required: true
    pattern: "regex-pattern"
    patternDescription: "human-readable format"
  stores: variableName
  instruction: |
    Agent instructions for processing user input:
    - Wait for user response
    - Parse and validate input
    - Store result
    - Handle edge cases
```

**Key Principles:**
- Always wait for user input (never skip elicitation)
- Provide clear examples and format guidance
- Validate user input with helpful error messages
- Store results for use in subsequent steps

### Error Handling

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md § Critical Rules]

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Missing template files → Display helpful error with path
- Missing schema files → Continue without schema (warn user)
- Missing mock data → Prompt user for inline data
- API errors → Show error message with context, offer retry

**Workspace Isolation:**
- All file operations within user workspace only
- Never access files outside workspace root
- Validate paths before read/write operations

### Testing

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Manual Testing via Claude Code:**
- Activate Prompt Engineer agent: `/poem/agents/penny`
- Execute refine workflow: `*refine {prompt-name}`
- Verify each step executes in order
- Verify template loads and renders correctly
- Verify modifications save properly
- Test with both existing and non-existent prompts
- Test in both development and production modes

**Unit Tests (Optional but Recommended):**
- Test file: `packages/poem-app/tests/workflows/refine-prompt.test.ts`
- Framework: Vitest (see testing-strategy.md)
- Focus: Workflow YAML structure validation
- Coverage: 75% (integration test level per NFR)

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Load existing prompt successfully
2. Handle non-existent prompt gracefully
3. Render with mock data
4. Render with inline data
5. Save modifications
6. Discard modifications
7. Multiple refinement iterations
8. Path resolution in dev vs prod mode

### Comparison with new-prompt.yaml

[Source: packages/poem-core/workflows/new-prompt.yaml]

**Similarities:**
- Both use pathResolution: config
- Both use elicitation steps for user interaction
- Both call POST /api/prompt/render for previews
- Both follow agent-interpreted execution model

**Differences:**
- `new-prompt` **creates** new files → `refine-prompt` **updates** existing files
- `new-prompt` gathers purpose/inputs → `refine-prompt` loads existing template
- `new-prompt` generates schema → `refine-prompt` optionally displays existing schema
- `refine-prompt` adds comparison feature (before/after rendering)
- `refine-prompt` adds iteration history (optional)

**Reusable Patterns:**
- Step structure with id, name, type, instruction
- Elicit steps with validation and stores fields
- Action steps calling API endpoints
- Output step summarizing workflow results
- Fallback configuration for error handling

### Implementation Notes

**Workflow Execution:**
- Agent-interpreted (not automated by system)
- Steps guide agent behavior through conversation
- Agent reads workflow YAML and follows instructions
- Elicit steps require user interaction (BMAD pattern)
- Action steps perform operations (API calls, file I/O)

**Iteration Loop Pattern:**
- Step 4 (render-current) → Step 5 (modification-method) → Step 6 (apply-modifications) → Step 7 (re-render) → Step 8 (confirm-save) → Step 10 (continue-refining)
- If user chooses "yes" in Step 10, loop back to Step 4 with updated template
- Track iteration count for summary in completion step

**Optional Enhancements:**
- Iteration history (AC 7) is optional
- If time allows, implement backup files and history tracking
- If not, note as "Future Enhancement" in workflow completion message

## QA Results

**Reviewer:** Quinn (QA Agent)
**Review Date:** 2026-01-09
**Quality Gate:** ✅ **PASS** (Score: 9.5/10)
**Gate File:** `docs/qa/gates/3.3-implement-refine-prompt-workflow.yml`

### Executive Summary

Story 3.3 successfully delivers a comprehensive refine-prompt workflow definition with 10 sequential steps covering all acceptance criteria. The implementation follows established patterns from new-prompt.yaml, uses proper architecture (pathResolution: config), and includes excellent test coverage with 31 passing unit tests. Documentation is thorough with a complete SAT guide containing 8 terminal tests.

Minor deduction (0.5 points) for deferred execution testing, which is acceptable given the story scope focuses on workflow DEFINITION, not runtime implementation.

### Recommendations

**Immediate:**
- ✅ Story can be marked as Done
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Documentation complete

**Future:**
- When Prompt Engineer agent runtime is available, execute workflow and validate behavior
- Consider adding workflow execution integration tests in future story

### Final Assessment

**Decision:** ✅ **PASS**

Story 3.3 delivers a high-quality workflow definition that meets all acceptance criteria with comprehensive test coverage. The implementation follows established patterns, uses proper architecture, and includes excellent documentation. The deferred execution testing is acceptable given the story scope.

All 7 acceptance criteria are fully satisfied with clear traceability to implementation and tests. Code quality is excellent with no technical debt. Documentation exceeds expectations with detailed SAT guide and troubleshooting.

**Recommendation:** Mark story as Done.
