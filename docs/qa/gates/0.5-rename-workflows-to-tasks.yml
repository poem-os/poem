nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security-sensitive files modified. Git history preserved for audit trail."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No runtime performance impact. Directory rename has no performance implications."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All 735 rename-related tests passing. No new failure modes introduced."
  maintainability:
    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: "Primary goal achieved - eliminated terminology confusion. Consistent naming across 60+ files."

recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Update docs/architecture/coding-standards.md:27 from 'Workflow files' to 'Task files' for consistency"
      refs: ["docs/architecture/coding-standards.md"]
      priority: low
      impact: cosmetic

review_highlights:
  strengths:
    - "Flawless mechanical rename execution - no find/replace errors"
    - "Git history preserved with git mv command"
    - "Comprehensive SAT guide created with 13 test cases"
    - "All 15 acceptance criteria validated with clear traceability"
    - "Historical documentation appropriately marked with notes"
    - "Test suite validates all critical paths (735 passing tests)"

  improvements_made:
    - "60+ files updated consistently across codebase"
    - "Test directory renamed for structural consistency"
    - "Documentation maintains coherence throughout"

  considerations:
    - "8 pre-existing test failures documented (API server tests, file watcher tests)"
    - "Pre-existing failures do not block this story - unrelated to rename"
    - "Minor cosmetic issue in coding-standards.md (low priority)"

effort_assessment:
  estimated: "1-2 hours (per triage)"
  actual: "~2 hours (based on comprehensive implementation)"
  complexity: "Low (mechanical rename)"
  scope: "Large (60+ files)"
  execution_quality: "Excellent"

risk_summary:
  overall_risk: LOW
  risk_factors:
    - factor: "Large file count (60+ files)"
      probability: medium
      impact: low
      mitigation: "Comprehensive test coverage and SAT validation"
      residual_risk: minimal
