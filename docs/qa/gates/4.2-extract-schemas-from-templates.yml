      priority: "low"
      rationale: "Performance optimization for high-volume scenarios (not needed for MVP)"

strengths:
  - "100% requirements traceability (all 12 ACs mapped to tests)"
  - "Clean architecture with proper service/API separation"
  - "Comprehensive error handling with Zod validation"
  - "Type-safe TypeScript implementation"
  - "Exceeds all coverage targets"
  - "Well-documented code with clear interfaces"

notes: |
  Story 4.2 demonstrates exceptional engineering quality. Implementation follows all
  best practices with clean architecture, comprehensive testing, and full standards
  compliance. SAT automation validated 10/12 tests (2 flagged for manual verification
  are low-priority and not blocking). Ready for production use.
