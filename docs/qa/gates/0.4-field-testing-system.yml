# Review Summary
review_highlights:
  strengths:
    - "Agent definition follows BMAD v4 patterns with clear persona and 3 commands"
    - "Skill adheres to Anthropic skill-creator guidelines (222 lines < 500 lines)"
    - "Schema versioning is backward compatible (v2.1 adds optional reportedBy array)"
    - "Documentation is thorough with architecture diagrams and workflow examples"
    - "Triage Mode E integrates seamlessly with existing Modes A-D"
    - "All 12 acceptance criteria fully verified via SAT terminal tests (10/10 passed)"

  areas_for_improvement:
    - "Hardcoded POEM inbox path (acceptable for MVP, noted for future)"
    - "Similarity matching algorithm described but not implemented (manual for MVP)"
    - "Bidirectional sync not implemented (one-way submission for MVP)"

# Risk Assessment

    monitor:
      - "Path configurability (low risk, future enhancement)"
      - "Similarity matching implementation (medium risk if inbox volume grows)"
      - "Bidirectional sync (low risk, nice-to-have)"
