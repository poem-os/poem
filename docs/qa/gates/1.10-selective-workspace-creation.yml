nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Workflow name validation prevents path traversal. Config file parsing uses trusted js-yaml library. No sensitive data handling."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Minimal file I/O operations. Directory creation is synchronous and fast. Config file YAML parsing is efficient."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Idempotent commands (init, add-workflow). Proper error handling for invalid names. Graceful skip messages for existing resources."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code with JSDoc comments. Clear separation of concerns (init.js, add-workflow.js). Consistent naming conventions (kebab-case). Terminology rename complete (workflow-state)."

compliance_notes:
  coding_standards: "Follows kebab-case naming. Uses ESM imports. Proper error handling with user-friendly messages."
  project_structure: "New command files in bin/commands/ directory. No workspace isolation violations."
  testing_strategy: "CONCERNS: Unit tests not written (Tasks 2.3, 3.3 incomplete). Integration tests pending (Task 7 incomplete). However, automated SAT tests validated core functionality."
  ac_coverage: "All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated via automated tests or code review."
