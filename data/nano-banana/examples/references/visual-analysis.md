```

**Mode 2: Branding/Identity**
```
prismor.dev
```

**Mode 3: Terminal Interface**
```
Claude Code v2.1.3
Welcome back Guillaume!
Opus 4.5 - Claude Pro - Organization: /Users/klye

## Comparison References

### Stream Deck XL Example (Image 2)
- Full-size Stream Deck with developer workflow buttons
- Custom icons showing cute robot/developer illustrations
- Workflow actions: "New Term", "Next Bead", "Ultrathink", "Fresh Review", "Git Commit", "Fix Bug"
- Shows the market space VibeDeck would compete in
- Demonstrates demand for developer-specific stream decks

### AJAZZ White Deck Example (Image 3)
- Premium white/cream housing
- Cleaner, more minimal aesthetic (Apple-esque)
- Blue backlit icons (simpler than Stream Deck's illustrations)
- Shows alternative color scheme option
- 3×5 or 4×4 grid layout

### Modular Single Key Example (Image 4)
- Individual macro key with clear housing
- Blue RGB underglow shining through transparent base
- Numbered keycap ("2")
- Shows potential for modular/expandable system
- Demonstrates underglow lighting approach

### UI Mockup - "P-BOT MODULATOR" (Image 7)
- Skeuomorphic interface design
- Modular window system (scan, evidence, explain, status, send modules)
- Industrial/technical aesthetic
- Toggle switches, analog meters, terminal windows
- Could inspire software interface for VibeDeck configuration

## Key Design Insights

### 1. The "YOLO MODE" Button is Iconic
- Red/salmon colored (danger/warning color)
- Prominent placement (top row, center-right)
- Likely the most distinctive feature
- Represents "ship it without overthinking" mentality
- Perfect for vibe coding culture

### 2. Display Integration is Critical
- Not just a button deck—it's an **information display + controller**
- Shows real-time status (task, progress, model, subscription)
- Provides context for button presses
- Could show prompt suggestions, errors, workflow state

### 3. Physical Controls Matter
- **Toggle switch** for model tier (tactile, satisfying)
- **Rotary encoder** for model selection (smooth scrolling through options)
- **Microphone** for voice input (essential for vibe coding)
- Not just buttons—varied input methods

### 4. Long-Form Button
- "SUGGEST NEXT PROMPT" spans most of the width
- Suggests it's a high-frequency action
- Easy to hit without looking
- Could be programmable for other "primary" actions

### 5. Cable Aesthetic
- Coiled cable (retro, functional)
- References old telephone cords
- Keeps desk tidy
- Nostalgic tech aesthetic

## Color Scheme Observations

**Primary**: Dark gray/gunmetal housing
**Accents**:
- Blue underglow/backlighting (most buttons)
- Red for YOLO MODE (danger/warning)
- Green for terminal text (classic hacker aesthetic)
- White for legends/labels

**Alternative schemes shown**:
- White/cream housing with blue lighting (clean/minimal)
- Weathered metal with rust (industrial/maker)

---

## Dimensions & Ergonomics

From visual analysis:

**Approximate size**: 8-10" wide × 3-4" tall × 1-2" deep
**Button count**: ~10-12 buttons + 2 analog controls (toggle, rotary)
**Display size**: ~4-5" wide × 1" tall (estimate)
**Angle**: Slight rear tilt for ergonomics (5-10 degrees)
**Footprint**: Smaller than full keyboard, fits between keyboard and monitor

---

## Context & Use Case

**Shown with**:
- Coiled cable (USB-C presumably)
- Dark wood desk
- Mechanical keyboard nearby (partial view)
- Professional home office environment
- No visible monitor (implies laptop or off-screen)

**Target user aesthetic**:
- Developer who values aesthetics
- Professional but playful ("YOLO MODE")
- Appreciates retro-tech nostalgia (coiled cable, terminal font)
- Willing to invest in specialized tools

---

## Comparison to Existing Products

**vs Stream Deck**:
- VibeDeck: More specialized (AI coding), integrated display, physical controls
- Stream Deck: More general purpose, LCD buttons, software-only

**vs Macro Pads**:
- VibeDeck: Dedicated purpose, intelligent features (suggest next prompt)
- Macro Pads: Generic programmable keys, no context awareness

**vs DIY Keyboards**:
- VibeDeck: Consumer product, polished, plug-and-play
- DIY: Requires assembly, programming knowledge, no software integration

## Marketing Opportunities

Based on these renders:

1. **"YOLO MODE" as Brand Icon** - This button is instantly recognizable, memeable
2. **Display = Differentiation** - Most stream decks don't have integrated status displays
3. **Retro-Tech Aesthetic** - Coiled cable, terminal font appeals to developer nostalgia
4. **Weathered Version** - Could offer alternative "skins" or limited editions
5. **Cross-Platform** - Mobile app mockup shows potential for software companion

## Questions These Images Raise

1. **Display technology**: OLED? LCD? LED matrix? (Affects cost)
2. **Rotary encoder**: What does it scroll through? Just models, or other settings?
3. **Toggle switch**: Two-position or three-position? (High/Low or High/Med/Low?)
4. **Button feel**: Mechanical switches? Cherry MX? Custom?
5. **Housing material**: Plastic or metal? (Affects price point)
6. **Cable**: Fixed or detachable? USB-C or proprietary?

---

## Next Steps

Based on these references:

1. **Finalize button layout** - This design shows ~10 buttons + 2 analog controls
2. **Display content strategy** - What info is most useful? Task? Model? Progress?
3. **Color variants** - Offer clean (gray) and premium (white) at launch?
4. **YOLO MODE definition** - What does this button actually do? (Needs spec)
5. **Software integration** - How does display update? API? Plugin?
