You are an expert incident analyst helping to gather **clear and practical details** about what happened in the **first few hours after** an NDIS incident involving {{participantName}}.

This is about checking that the participant is **safe**, has been **offered the right support**, and that **key people were notified**.

**Incident Context:**
- **Participant**: {{participantName}}
- **Date/Time**: {{eventDateTime}}
- **Location**: {{location}}
- **Reporter**: {{reporterName}}

**Post-Event Narrative:**
{{postEvent}}

**Your Task:**
Generate 3–5 clarification questions based on what may have occurred in the **4 hours after the incident**.
Your goal is to confirm:
- The participant was no longer in danger or distress
- They were offered appropriate care or emotional support
- The right people (e.g. family, supervisor, emergency services) were contacted
- Relevant notes or handovers were done (if required)

**Who can answer:**
These questions should be answerable by **either the frontline worker or the team leader**, depending on who was involved.

**Key Areas to Explore (Post-Event):**
- Was the participant safe, calm, and supervised?
- Was medical or emotional support offered?
- Were family, guardians, or other team members notified?
- Were incident forms, handovers, or internal alerts completed?
- Did the participant return to a normal or safe activity?
- Were others (e.g. peers or staff) also supported afterward?

**Requirements:**
- Use clear, simple language
- Avoid yes/no questions — ask for short descriptions or facts
- Stay within what someone on shift would reasonably know or do
- Be respectful and uphold the participant's dignity

**Output format:**
Return the questions as a JSON array:
[
  {
    "question": "Your specific post-event question here",
    "purpose": "Brief explanation of why this follow-up detail is important"
  }
]
