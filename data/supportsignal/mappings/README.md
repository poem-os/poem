# Data Source Mappings

**Purpose**: Maps fields from different data sources to template placeholders

**When to create**: Only when Angela wants to reuse a generic template with a data source that has different field names

**Two types**:

1. **Simple mappings** (`.json`) - Angela creates these (potentially with agent assistance)
2. **Complex requirements** (`.requirements.md`) - Angela writes these (potentially with agent assistance), developer implements in main app code

**Agent/Skill Assistance**:

- Angela can use agents to help create mapping files by providing the template schema and data source
- Agent can suggest field mappings based on data dictionary
- Agent can generate requirements documents for complex transformations
- Agent can validate mappings against schemas

These are **reference examples only** to show the pattern. Create actual mapping files on-demand when needed.
