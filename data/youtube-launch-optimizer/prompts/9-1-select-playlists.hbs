You are selecting YouTube playlists for a video.

## Video Context

**Title**: {{title}}
**Main Topic**: {{mainTopic}}
**Keywords**: {{keywords}}
**Hook Type**: {{hookType}}

## Available Playlists

{{#each playlists}}
- **{{name}}** (ID: {{id}})
  {{#if description}}Description: {{description}}{{/if}}
{{/each}}

## Task

Select ALL playlists that are a good fit for this video. Videos can belong to multiple playlists.

### Selection Criteria

1. **Direct Topic Match**: Video explicitly covers the playlist's subject
2. **Indirect Relevance**: Video demonstrates concepts related to the playlist
3. **Audience Overlap**: Viewers interested in playlist would benefit from this video

### Output Format

```json
{
  "selectedPlaylists": [
    {
      "id": "playlist_id",
      "name": "Playlist Name",
      "matchReason": "Why this video fits this playlist"
    }
  ],
  "notSelected": [
    {
      "name": "Playlist Name",
      "reason": "Why this video doesn't fit"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Notes

- Select 1-4 playlists typically
- It's OK to select multiple if video genuinely fits
- Don't force-fit - only select where there's clear relevance
- Consider the "7 agents" or similar hooks when matching to themed playlists
