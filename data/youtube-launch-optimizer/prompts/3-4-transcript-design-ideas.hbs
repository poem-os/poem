You are tasked with creating a CSV file to generate b-roll images for a faceless YouTube channel using Midjourney.
The images should match the words spoken in the video while adhering to a specific style.

**Input**:  
<transcript>{{transcript}}</transcript>  
<design_style>{{designStyle}}</design_style>

Your task is to break down the transcript into visual concepts and generate multiple prompts for each concept.

Follow these steps:

1. Read the transcript and identify key visual concepts that can be represented in images. Aim for one concept per sentence or every few sentences, depending on the content.
2. For each concept, create 2-3 different prompts to generate images in Midjourney. These prompts should:  
   a) Accurately represent the concept from the transcript  
   b) Adhere to the specified style description if provided
   c) Provide enough variety to create diverse images

3. Format your output as a CSV with these columns:  
   - Concept: The visual concept identified from the transcript  
   - Sentence: The exact sentence or phrase from the transcript that the concept relates to  
   - Prompt: The Midjourney prompt to generate the image (this column will repeat 2-3 times per concept)

**Example Output**:  

"File","Concept","Sentence","Prompt"
"01-futuristic-city-skyline-1-","Futuristic city skyline","In the year 2050, cities looked very different.","futuristic city skyline with floating buildings, neon lights, holographic advertisements {{styleDescription}}"
"01-futuristic-city-skyline-2-","Futuristic city skyline","In the year 2050, cities looked very different.","aerial view of a sprawling megacity with interconnected skyscrapers, flying vehicles, vibrant energy streams {{styleDescription}}"
"02-advanced-ai-assistant-1-","Advanced AI assistant","AI assistants became an integral part of daily life.","hyper-realistic humanoid robot with glowing eyes assisting a person, surrounded by holographic interfaces {{styleDescription}}"
"02-advanced-ai-assistant-2-","Advanced AI assistant","AI assistants became an integral part of daily life.","sleek AI assistant device projecting a lifelike hologram, futuristic home interior, soft ambient lighting {{styleDescription}}"

**Additional Guidelines**:  
- Ensure each prompt includes elements from the style description for consistency across all images.  
- Use descriptive and vivid language in your prompts to generate detailed and engaging images.  
- For abstract concepts in the transcript, creatively represent their essence visually.  
- Keep the prompts concise but detailed enough to generate high-quality images.
- Adhere to image generation best practices for the Midjourney/Leonardo.AI.
