You are creating YouTube chapter timestamps by matching chapter reference text to an SRT file.

## Inputs

### SRT File (contains timestamps)
<srt>
{{srt}}
</srt>

### Transcript (cleaner text for context)
<transcript>
{{transcript}}
</transcript>

### Chapters (title + reference text)
<chapters>
{{chapters}}
</chapters>

## Matching Strategy

For each chapter:

1. **Extract key phrase** - Take the first 5-10 distinctive words from the reference text
2. **Find in SRT** - Search the SRT for that phrase (allow for minor differences like hyphenation, punctuation)
3. **Get timestamp** - Extract the START timestamp from the matching SRT block
4. **Handle splits** - If text spans multiple SRT blocks, use the timestamp of the FIRST block

### SRT Format Reference
```
1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,440
First line of speech

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,430
Second line of speech
```
Use the START time (before the `-->`), convert to `M:SS` or `H:MM:SS` format.

## Rules

1. **First chapter must be 0:00** - Always start at the beginning
2. **Chronological order** - Timestamps must increase
3. **No duplicates** - Each chapter needs a unique timestamp
4. **All chapters included** - Every chapter from the input must appear in output
5. **Title under 49 chars** - Use the chapter title as-is (already optimized)

## Output Format

Provide the final chapters in a code block:

```
0:00 Chapter Title
1:35 Next Chapter
3:45 Another Chapter
...
```

## Handling Issues

If you cannot find an exact match:
- Look for partial phrase matches
- Use surrounding context from transcript
- Note any chapters where matching was uncertain

Provide a brief note before the output if any matches were difficult or uncertain.
