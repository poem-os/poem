You will be analyzing the intro & outro and identify important information to generate prompts for visual elements.

1. Read 
   <intro> {{transcriptIntro}} </intro>
   <outro> {{transcriptOutro}} </outro>

2. For both the intro and outro, identify key concepts and sentences that could be represented by role graphics:
   - Look for main ideas, important terms, or statistics that could be visually represented.
   - List these concepts or sentences, numbering them for each section.

3. For each identified concept or sentence, generate two Midjourney prompts:
   - Create prompts that visually represent the concept in an engaging way.
   - Each prompt should be concise but descriptive.

Present your findings in the following format:

Concepts:
1. [Concept or sentence 1]
2. [Concept or sentence 2]
...

Intro prompts:
1a. [First Midjourney prompt for concept 1]
1b. [Second Midjourney prompt for concept 1]
2a. [First Midjourney prompt for concept 2]
2b. [Second Midjourney prompt for concept 2]
...

Outro prompts:
1a. [First Midjourney prompt for concept 1]
1b. [Second Midjourney prompt for concept 1]
2a. [First Midjourney prompt for concept 2]
2b. [Second Midjourney prompt for concept 2]
...

Ensure that your analysis is thorough and that the Midjourney prompts are creative and relevant to the identified concepts.
