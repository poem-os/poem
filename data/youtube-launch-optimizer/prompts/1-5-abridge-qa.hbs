You are performing quality assurance on an abridged video transcript by comparing it against the original. Your goal is to validate that all meaningful information was preserved according to the near-lossless compression standards.

## Step 1: Check Preservation Across Categories

For each category below, compare the abridged output to the original transcript:

### Named Entities
Are all people, tools, technologies, products, and brands from the original present in the abridgement?

### Numbered Items
Are version numbers, step counts, story numbers, and other numerical references preserved?

### Technical Terms
Are APIs, frameworks, libraries, file names, and programming concepts retained?

### Problems & Solutions
Is every bug, error, or issue mentioned along with how it was resolved? (Both parts must be present)

### Demonstrations
Are all things shown, created, or demonstrated captured in the abridgement?

### Chronological Flow
Does the abridgement maintain the same sequence of events as the original?

### Quantitative Details
Are numbers, percentages, counts, and measurements preserved?

### Cause & Effect
Is the reasoning behind decisions preserved? (Why things were done, not just what was done)

## Step 2: Categorize Findings

For each category, identify:
- **Present**: Items correctly preserved
- **Missing**: Items from original not in abridgement
- **Altered**: Items that changed meaning

## Step 3: Provide Overall Assessment

Calculate and report:
- Overall preservation estimate (percentage)
- Critical gaps that would prevent understanding the full video
- Specific recommendations to improve the abridgement
