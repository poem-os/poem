Accuracy Check for Abridged Transcript (Structured)

Compare the abridged output to the original transcript. Check preservation across specific categories, then list any discrepancies found.

## Check These Categories

### Named Entities
Are all people, tools, technologies, products, and brands from the original present in the abridgement?

### Numbered Items
Are version numbers, step counts, story numbers, and other numerical references preserved?

### Technical Terms
Are APIs, frameworks, libraries, file names, and programming concepts retained?

### Problems & Solutions
Is every bug, error, or issue mentioned along with how it was resolved? (Both parts must be present)

### Demonstrations
Are all things shown, created, or demonstrated captured in the abridgement?

### Chronological Flow
Does the abridgement maintain the same sequence of events as the original?

### Quantitative Details
Are numbers, percentages, counts, and measurements preserved?

## Output Format

For each category, report:
- **Present**: Items correctly preserved
- **Missing**: Items from original not in abridgement
- **Altered**: Items that changed meaning

Then provide:
- **Overall Preservation Estimate**: X% of meaningful content retained
- **Critical Gaps**: Any omissions that would prevent understanding the full video
- **Recommendations**: Specific additions to improve the abridgement
