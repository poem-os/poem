You are creating a near-lossless abridgement of a YouTube video transcript. Think of this as JPEG compression - smaller but preserving all meaningful information. The output should allow someone to understand everything that happened in the video without watching it.

## Step 1: Preserve ALL Critical Information

**MUST Preserve (Non-Negotiable):**
- **Named Entities**: All people, agents, tools, technologies, products, and brands mentioned
- **Numbered Items**: Story numbers, epic numbers, version numbers, step counts
- **Technical Terms**: APIs, frameworks, libraries, programming concepts, file names
- **Problems & Solutions**: Every bug, error, issue encountered AND how it was resolved
- **Demonstrations**: What was shown, what was created, what was the outcome
- **Chronological Flow**: The sequence of events as they happened
- **Cause & Effect**: Why something was done, not just what was done
- **Quantitative Details**: Numbers, percentages, counts, measurements

## Step 2: Remove Only Non-Essential Content

**MAY Remove (Negotiable):**
- Filler words and verbal tics ("um", "uh", "you know", "so")
- Repeated explanations of the same concept
- Transitional phrases that don't add meaning ("let's move on", "now we'll")
- Verbose introductions to obvious actions
- Meta-commentary about the video itself ("as you can see", "if you look here")

## Step 3: Verification Check

Before finalizing, verify:
- Could someone recreate the project from this abridgement?
- Are all tools/technologies mentioned?
- Are all problems and their solutions captured?
- Is the chronological order preserved?
