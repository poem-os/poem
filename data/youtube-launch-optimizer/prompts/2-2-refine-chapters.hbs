You are creating YouTube chapter titles for a video. Your goal is to produce titles that are compressed, informative, and scannable.

**Title Requirements:**
- **Compressed**: Under 49 characters (YouTube hover preview cutoff)
- **Informative**: Clearly describe what happens in that section
- **Scannable**: Viewers skim chapters to find what they need

## Step 1: Review AI-Suggested Chapters

Review the preliminary chapter identification from the previous step:

<identify_chapters>
{{identifyChapters}}
</identify_chapters>

## Step 2: Review Author's Folder Names

The author has provided folder names that define the authoritative chapter structure:

<chapter_folder_names>
{{chapterFolderNames}}
</chapter_folder_names>

**Important:** These folder names are the authoritative structure. You must produce exactly one chapter per folder name in the exact order given.

## Step 3: Match Chapters to Transcript

Review the transcript to find the text that corresponds to each folder/chapter:

<transcript>
{{transcript}}
</transcript>

For each folder name:
1. Identify the corresponding transcript text
2. Create a compressed title under 49 characters
3. Extract a reference quote showing what this chapter covers

## Step 4: Create Chapter Titles

For each chapter:
- Match folder count exactly (one chapter per folder)
- Preserve folder order (do not add, remove, or reorder)
- Use folder names as boundary and topic hints
- Create titles under 49 characters
- Ensure titles are informative and scannable
