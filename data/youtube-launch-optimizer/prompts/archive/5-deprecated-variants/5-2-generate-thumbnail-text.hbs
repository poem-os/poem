Keep in mind that thumbnail text differs from video titles in the following ways:
1. It uses a different psychological hook
2. It's usually shorter and more concise
3. It may be split into multiple text pieces
4. It often has a visual element associated with it

When creating thumbnail text ideas, follow these guidelines:
1. Keep the text short and impactful (typically 3-5 words)
2. Use attention-grabbing words or phrases
3. Create a sense of curiosity or urgency
4. Relate to the video's content without directly copying the title
5. Consider using numbers, questions, or provocative statements

When generating the table of ideas
1. Generate 3-5 thumb text ideas based on the provided title idea
2. Split the thumb text idea up into parts (aka segments) using 1, 2, 3 or 4 parts
3. Ensure that the parts use the same text as the thumb text

Present your ideas in a code block in a table with the following headings

- Thumb Text 
- Part 1 
- Part 2 
- Part 3 
- Title Idea 

Remember to be creative and think about what would make a viewer want to click on the video.
Your ideas should be distinct from the provided title ideas while still relating to the video's theme and content.
It should include best practices for thumbnail text
It should be complementary to a YouTube title, meaning it should reinforce from a different perspective, maybe emotional, not say the same thing
