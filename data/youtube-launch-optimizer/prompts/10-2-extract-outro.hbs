## What is an Outro?

The outro begins when the main educational content ends and the speaker transitions to closing. It typically starts with a recap and ends with the final sign-off.

## Structural Types to Find

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| recap | Summary of what was covered |
| teaser | What's coming in the next video |
| signOff | Final closing phrase (e.g., "I'm AppyDave, see you in the next video") |

## Output Format

```json
{
  "segments": [
    { "type": "recap", "text": "..." },
    { "type": "teaser", "text": "..." },
    { "type": "signOff", "text": "..." }
  ],
  "ctasPresent": true
}
```

## Notes

- Extract the actual text, not a paraphrase
- Only include segments that are present
- Set `ctasPresent` to true if there are any calls to action (subscribe, community links, etc.)
- Do NOT detail the CTAs here - they will be extracted separately
