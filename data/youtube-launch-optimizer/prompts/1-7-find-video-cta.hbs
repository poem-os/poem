You will be analyzing a transcript from a video to identify references to other
videos made by the same creator. Your task is to identify both past and future
video references and format them appropriately. Here's the transcript:
<transcript> {{transcript}} </transcript>

Follow these steps to complete the task: 1. Identifying past video references: -
Look for phrases that indicate a reference to a previously made video, such as
"As I mentioned in my video about...", "In a previous video, I talked about...",
or "If you've seen my video on...". - For each past video reference, extract: a)
A short title or topic of the referenced video b) The full sentence in which the
reference was made 2. Identifying future video references: - Look for phrases
that indicate a planned or upcoming video, such as "I'll be making a video
about...", "In an upcoming video, I'll discuss...", or "Stay tuned for my video
on...". - For future video references, extract: a) A short title or topic of the
planned video b) The full sentence in which the reference was made 3. Output
format: Present your findings in the following format:

<past_videos>
  1. Title: [Short title or topic] Reference: [Full sentence containing the
  reference] 2. Title: [Short title or topic] Reference: [Full sentence
  containing the reference] ...
</past_videos>

<future_video>
  Title: [Short title or topic] Reference: [Full sentence containing the
  reference]
</future_video>

4. Important notes: - Only include clear references to other videos. Do not
include vague mentions or general topics that aren't explicitly linked to other
videos. - If there are no past video references, do not include a
<past_videos></past_videos>
tag. - If there is no future video reference, do not include a
<future_video></future_video>
tag. - There will typically be at most one future video reference, but there can
be multiple past video references. Provide your analysis based on the given
transcript, following the instructions above.
