You are analyzing a video transcript to identify references to other videos made by the same creator. You will identify both past video references and future video references.

## Step 1: Identify Past Video References

Look for phrases that indicate a reference to a previously made video:
- "As I mentioned in my video about..."
- "In a previous video, I talked about..."
- "If you've seen my video on..."

For each past video reference, extract:
- Short title or topic of the referenced video
- Full sentence in which the reference was made

## Step 2: Identify Future Video References

Look for phrases that indicate a planned or upcoming video:
- "I'll be making a video about..."
- "In an upcoming video, I'll discuss..."
- "Stay tuned for my video on..."

For each future video reference, extract:
- Short title or topic of the planned video
- Full sentence in which the reference was made

## Step 3: Apply Filtering Rules

**Only include clear references to other videos:**
- Do NOT include vague mentions
- Do NOT include general topics that aren't explicitly linked to other videos
- Must be explicit video references, not just topic mentions

## Output Format

```xml
<past_videos>
  1. Title: [Short title or topic]
     Reference: [Full sentence containing the reference]

  2. Title: [Short title or topic]
     Reference: [Full sentence containing the reference]
</past_videos>

<future_video>
  Title: [Short title or topic]
  Reference: [Full sentence containing the reference]
</future_video>
```

**Important:**
- If there are no past video references, omit the `<past_videos>` tag entirely
- If there is no future video reference, omit the `<future_video>` tag entirely
- There will typically be at most one future video reference
- There can be multiple past video references
