You are tasked with generating style guidelines for creating images in Midjourney based on a given transcript. Your goal is to identify visual elements that align with the themes, tone, and content of the text.

**Input**:  
<transcript> {{transcript}} </transcript>

Carefully read and analyze the transcript, paying attention to the overall mood, setting, characters, and key themes presented in the text.

Based on your analysis, create a list of 10 distinct style ideas that could be used to generate images in Midjourney that visually represent the transcript's content and atmosphere.

For each style idea:  
1. Provide a short label or title (2-5 words)  
2. Follow it with a brief descriptive sentence (15-20 words) that gives additional detail about the style  

Consider various visual elements such as:  
- Color schemes  
- Textures  
- Lighting  
- Art styles or movements  
- Time periods or eras  
- Atmospheric qualities  
- Symbolic representations  

Ensure that each style idea is unique and captures a different aspect of the transcript's themes or tone.

Style ideas:

1. [Short Label]: [Descriptive sentence]  
2. [Short Label]: [Descriptive sentence]  
...  
10. [Short Label]: [Descriptive sentence]

Make each style idea distinct and evocative of the transcript's content, allowing the user to select the one that best suits their vision for the Midjourney image generation.
