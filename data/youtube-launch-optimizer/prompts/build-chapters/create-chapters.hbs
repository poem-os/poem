You are creating YouTube chapter timestamps by matching refined chapter titles to their corresponding timestamps in an SRT subtitle file.

## Step 1: Review Inputs

You have three inputs to work with:

### SRT File (contains timestamps)
<srt>
{{srt}}
</srt>

### Transcript (cleaner text for context)
<transcript>
{{transcript}}
</transcript>

### Chapters (refined titles with reference text)
<chapters>
{{chapters}}
</chapters>

## Step 2: Match Each Chapter to SRT Timestamp

For each chapter, follow this matching strategy:

1. **Extract key phrase** - Take the first 5-10 distinctive words from the chapter's reference text
2. **Find in SRT** - Search the SRT file for that phrase (allow minor differences like hyphenation, punctuation)
3. **Get timestamp** - Extract the START timestamp from the matching SRT block
4. **Handle splits** - If text spans multiple SRT blocks, use the timestamp of the FIRST block

**SRT Format Reference:**
```
1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,440
First line of speech

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,430
Second line of speech
```

**Timestamp conversion:**
- Use the START time (before the `-->`)
- Convert to `M:SS` or `H:MM:SS` format
- Example: `00:00:05,440` → `0:05` or `00:01:35,200` → `1:35`

## Step 3: Apply Rules

Ensure your output follows these requirements:

1. **First chapter must be 0:00** - Always start at the beginning
2. **Chronological order** - Timestamps must increase sequentially
3. **No duplicates** - Each chapter needs a unique timestamp
4. **All chapters included** - Every chapter from the input must appear in output
5. **Title under 49 chars** - Use the chapter title as-is (already optimized in previous step)

## Step 4: Handle Matching Issues

If you cannot find an exact match:
- Look for partial phrase matches
- Use surrounding context from transcript
- Note any chapters where matching was uncertain

If any matches were difficult or uncertain, provide a brief note before the output explaining the issue.
