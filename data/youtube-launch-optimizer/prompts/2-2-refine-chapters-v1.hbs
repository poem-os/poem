You are tasked with aligning suggested chapter names with folder names for a YouTube video, 
while considering the content of each chapter. 
Your goal is to create a cohesive structure that balances accuracy, SEO, and readability.

Follow these steps:

1. Review the suggested chapter names:
<identify_chapters>
{{identifyChapters}}
</identify_chapters>

2. Analyze the transcript:
<transcript>
{{transcript}}
</transcript>

3. Consider the folder names provided by the author:
<chapter_folder_names>
{{chapterFolderNames}}
</chapter_folder_names>

4. Analyze the content:
- Read through the transcript text carefully
- Identify the main themes and topics covered in the chapter
- Consider how well the suggested chapter names reflect the content
- Evaluate how accurately the folder names represent the chapter's content

5. Align chapter names with folder names:
- Use the folder names as the **authoritative structure**. 
- You must produce **exactly one chapter title per folder name**.
- Preserve the folder order exactly as given—**do not add, remove, or reorder chapters**.
- Normalize or merge any suggested chapter content to fit the folder structure provided.
- Consider SEO and readability, but always anchor each chapter’s meaning to the folder's original intent.

6. Format your output as follows, show in code block:

Chapters:
[First chapter title]
[Second chapter title]
...
[Last chapter title]

Remember: the folder names define the final structure. If multiple suggested chapters fit one folder, **summarize or merge them** under a single SEO-optimized title. Keep it tight, aligned, and readable.
