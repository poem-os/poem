## What is a Breakout?

A breakout is a self-contained moment that diverges from the main sequential content. These are tangents, demonstrations, or emergent learnings that could potentially stand alone.

## Signal Phrases to Look For

- "Let me just..."
- "I'm going to open a new conversation..."
- "Let me show you..."
- "Here's what happened..."
- "Let's do a quick..."
- "Actually, let me..."
- "Side note..."
- "One thing I noticed..."

## Output Format

```json
{
  "items": [
    { "text": "...", "position": "early" },
    { "text": "...", "position": "middle" },
    { "text": "...", "position": "late" }
  ]
}
```

## Position Guide

| Position | Where in Video |
|----------|---------------|
| early | First third of main content |
| middle | Middle third of main content |
| late | Final third of main content |

## Notes

- Extract the key text that captures the breakout moment
- Include enough context to understand what the breakout is about
- Do not classify breakout type (demo/retrospective/etc.) - that's for later analysis
- Focus on moments that could stand alone or be repurposed
