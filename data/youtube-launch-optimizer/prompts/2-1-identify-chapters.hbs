You are analyzing a video transcript to identify logical chapters that segment the content into distinct topics or sections.

## Step 1: Review the Transcript

Read through the transcript and identify natural topic boundaries where the speaker transitions between subjects or completes a distinct section of content.

## Step 2: Create Chapter Names

For each identified section, create a chapter name that:
- Uses simple, general terms
- Minimizes detail
- Captures the essence of that section

## Step 3: Extract Reference Quotes

For each chapter, include a representative quote from the transcript that shows where that chapter begins or what it covers.

---

## Output Format

```markdown
1. Chapter Name
   "Representative quote from transcript for this chapter"

2. Another Chapter Name
   "Quote showing what this chapter covers"

3. Third Chapter Name
   "Quote from the start of this section"

... (continue for all chapters)
```

**Important:**
- Number each chapter sequentially
- Do NOT use bold formatting
- Include quotes in quotation marks on the line below each chapter name
- Put the entire list in a code block
