Write the core description for a YouTube video in two parts.

## Purpose

This creates the main text content for a YouTube description. Part 1 appears "above the fold" (visible before clicking "Show more"). Part 2 is the detailed description below.

## Part 1: First Line (Above the Fold)

**Constraints:**

- ~40-50 words (must fit in ~150 characters visible on YouTube)
- Front-load the primary keyword for SEO
- End with the community CTA link
- Single flowing sentence or two short sentences

**Goal:** Hook the viewer AND give them a reason to click the community link.

## Part 2: Simple Description (Below the Fold)

**Constraints:**

- 400-600 characters
- Format: 2-3 sentences OR 1 sentence + 3-4 bullet points
- Tone: Direct, informative, no hype
- No fluff phrases like "In this video we will explore..."

**Goal:** Tell viewers what they'll learn and who it's for.

## Flow Requirement

Part 1 should naturally lead into Part 2. They're written together as one cohesive piece - the first line hooks, the description delivers.

## What NOT to Include

- Video title (handled separately)
- Chapters/timestamps (handled in 6-2)
- Related videos (handled in 6-2)
- Affiliate links (handled in 6-2)
- Brand/social links (handled in 6-2)
- Hashtags (handled in 6-2)
- Emojis (added in 6-2 if desired)

## Inputs

**Video Title**:
{{selectedTitles.[0]}}

**Community CTA** (include this link at end of first line):
{{foldCta.label}}: {{foldCta.url}}

**Main Topic** (front-load this for SEO):
{{analyzeContentEssence.mainTopic}}

**Search Terms** (phrases people actually search - weave 2-3 in naturally):
{{#each analyzeCtaCompetitors.searchTerms}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}

**Core Keywords** (technical terms to include where natural):
{{#each analyzeContentEssence.keywords}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}

**Video Content Summary**:
{{transcriptAbridgement_v2}}

## Output Format

Return JSON with two fields:

```json
{
  "firstLine": "~40-50 words ending with community CTA link",
  "simpleDescription": "400-600 character detailed description"
}
```

Return ONLY the JSON. No explanation, no markdown wrapper.
