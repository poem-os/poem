# POEM Dev Workspace

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: This folder's STRUCTURE is transient, but VALIDATION DATA is valuable!**
>
> **Safe**: Re-run `./scripts/dev-setup.sh` anytime (preserves existing data)
> **Unsafe**: `rm -rf dev-workspace` (loses validation history!)
>
> Once Victor agent has run, this folder contains real test data. Back it up before deleting.

This directory is the **development testing workspace** for POEM framework developers.

## Purpose

1. **User-generated content** - Prompts, schemas, mock data created during development
2. **Validation artifacts** - Test reports, snapshots, matrices (data from Victor agent runs)

## Directory Structure

## Important Notes

- This directory is **gitignored** - contents are not committed
- This README is **generated** by `scripts/dev-setup.sh`
- In **production mode**, user content goes to `poem/` instead
- The config service automatically detects which mode you're in

## Mode Detection

| Mode | Detection | User Content Location |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| Development | `POEM_DEV=true` | `dev-workspace/` |
| Production | `POEM_DEV` not set | `poem/` |

## Documentation

**For guides and documentation**, see the **permanent docs** (not in this transient folder):

- **Workflow Validation Guide**: `docs/guides/workflow-validation-guide.md` - How to use Victor agent
- **Future Enhancements**: `docs/future-enhancements.md` - Upcoming features and Epic 8 tracking
- **BMAD Integration Requirements**: `docs/planning/bmad-integration/capability-validation-requirements.md`

**This folder contains only:**
- Run-specific data (test reports, snapshots, matrices)
- Transient testing content (prompts, schemas, mock data)

## Victor Agent (Workflow Validator)

**Capability Progression Validation** - Product-level QA that validates capabilities across stories:

```bash
# Activate Victor
/poem/agents/workflow-validator

# Run full validation (60-90 min)
*validate

# Quick regression check (10-15 min)
*regression
```

**Artifacts created by Victor** (in this workspace):
- `test-reports/` - Cumulative epic progress reports
- `test-runs/B72/` - Workflow snapshots for regression comparison
- `integration-matrix.md` - Capability integration test results
- `feedback-for-bmad.md` - Strategic feedback for BMAD story planning

**See**: `docs/guides/workflow-validation-guide.md` for complete documentation

## Regenerating This Folder

```bash
# From project root

# Or manually
rm -rf dev-workspace && ./scripts/dev-setup.sh
```
