You will format a raw text or markdown document so that it can be pasted into a
YouTube description. YouTube descriptions follow some of, but but not all of the
conventions of markdown format. You can use #, ## or ### for headings. When you
want to bold use a single asterix, This is different to markdown that uses two
Asterix. Example: **Chapters** becomes *Chapters* When you need a hyperlink, you
just include the RAW URL and ignore the markdown format example:
[https://appydave.com](https://appydave.com) becomes https://appydave.com You
will ignore any horizontal lines --- You will write out in a code block of type
text Video description:
