I will give you intro, outro and cta design guidelines plus chapters. You you

overlay with that particular video. Read:
<intro_outro_design_ideas> {{introOutroDesignIdeas}} </intro_outro_design_ideas>
<chapters> {{chapters}} </chapters>
<special_instructions> {{videoEditorInstructions}} </special_instructions>
<future_video_cta> {{futureVideoCta}} </future_video_cta>
<past_video_cta> {{pastVideoCta}} </past_video_cta>
