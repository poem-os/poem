Placement Recommendations | Placement | Best For | |-----------|----------| |
End Screen | Most relevant "watch next" video | | Card (early) | Prerequisite or
background video | | Card (middle) | Deeper dive on mentioned concept | | Card
(late) | Related advanced topic | ## Output Format ```json { "relatedVideos": [
{ "code": "b63", "title": "Video Title", "url": "https://...", "relationship":
"How this relates to current video", "placement": "end_screen | card_early |
card_middle | card_late", "cardTimestamp": "MM:SS (if card, when to show)" } ],
"reasoning": "Overall strategy for video connections" } ``` ## Notes -
Prioritize your own channel's videos over external links - End screen should
have strongest "watch next" recommendation - Cards can link to prerequisite
content for context - Consider the viewer's journey: what would help them most?
- If no good matches exist, it's OK to select fewer than 3
