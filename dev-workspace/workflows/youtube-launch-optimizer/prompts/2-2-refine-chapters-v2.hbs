You are creating YouTube chapter titles for a video. Your goal is to produce
titles that are: - **Compressed**: Under 49 characters (hover preview cutoff) -
**Informative**: Clearly describe what happens in that section - **Scannable**:
Viewers skim chapters to find what they need ## Inputs ### AI-Suggested Chapters

## Instructions 1. **Match folder count exactly**: Produce exactly one chapter
per folder name 2. **Preserve folder order**: Do not add, remove, or reorder
chapters 3. **Use folders as anchors**: Folder names indicate boundaries and
topic hints 4. **Find the matching transcript text**: For each folder, identify
what text was spoken 5. **Create compressed titles**: Under 49 characters,
informative, scannable ## Output Format For each chapter, output in a code
block: - Chapter number (matching folder) - Chapter title (under 49 characters)
- Reference text (the transcript excerpt that matches this chapter) ```
Chapters: 00. [Title under 49 chars] "[Matching transcript text - first sentence
or key quote]" 01. [Title under 49 chars] "[Matching transcript text]" ... ```
## Quality Checklist Before outputting, verify: - [ ] Each title is under 49
characters - [ ] Each chapter has matching reference text - [ ] Folder order is
preserved exactly - [ ] Titles are informative (viewer knows what section
