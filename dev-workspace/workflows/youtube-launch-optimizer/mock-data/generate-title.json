  "transcript": "Claude Opus 4.5 just got released and my initial reaction was who cares and the reason for that is I use Sonnet every day and I use Opus every now and then when I need to do a little bit of planning but I saw the reports that it was an exceptional coding model so I thought why don't I go and look at an old project of mine something from over a year ago where I had a little bit of requirements document and say how quickly could you build a functional application I have to say I've been totally blown away I'm happy Dave let's get into it As a YouTuber the most difficult part of this job is the planning, the recording, the editing and the publishing. It's never about the content ideas or how we build the software in my particular case. Now a year and a half ago I designed some software ideas called FlyVideo to deal with them. How do I do all the preparation? How do I do the recording which is the area we're looking at today by the way? How do we do the editing which is done later on and then how do we do the publishing? So the publishing for me is generally done using software I've built called the Agent Workflow Builder. It takes care of using large language models to deal with the publishing workflow like creating blog posts, that sort of stuff. I also use Agent Workflow Builder for the pre-production but it's the recording that can be really time consuming and it's to do with areas like how do I rename and set up all my projects across different brands? How do I name the files so that they have how when I record a file how does it get named and how when I name how when I record a file how does it get named? How does it get moved into the right chapter, the right segment, the right labeling? How when I record a file how does it get labeled? How does it get how when I record a file how does it get a proper chapter heading, a segment number, a label and automatically routed into the video project or discarded quickly? You might think that this is fairly simple but it's more complex than you think so the video that you're watching right now is actually complete I'm just in the middle of doing chapter 2 which is the scenario and when I'm finished recording this segment it's going to go between number one the intro and number three the demonstration. Well today we're going to see how in about 20 minutes Claude Opus was able to create this entire application I'll just demonstrate a part of it now because before I did this part of the recording I have a I have a particular file here that I don't care about anymore so we're just going to click this so we're just going to click discard and we should see some nice messaging and the file disappears. So let's get into the demonstration So I'm testing this application out for the first time I don't even know if it's going to work but let's see what happens so here's what we've got to start with we're going to click on the config button and apparently there's a location where the ecamm live files will drop and then there's a target where they're going to end up. So I'm just going to alter this to the actual directory for me and we'll see whether the tilde actually works as well and this is based off this particular folder where ecamm live files should drop now the other now we also need a target directory so what I'm going to do is create a new folder for this particular video and we're going to call it B72 we'll go with sonnet 2.5 awesome because I'm hoping it is going to be awesome and we'll create an assets and recordings file and and we'll create an assets and recordings folder now I'm hoping that this is the folder that the files are going to get transferred to so we'll come back to this temporary directory and we've got our target directory filled in again using a tilde for the user directory So what's really cool is it's picked up the file but it did have a minor bug so when I put in the watch directory and the target directory and I hit save I didn't see anything happen I never saw any files move I wasn't sure what to expect and so what I did was I just pasted in the information I had in screen and a little message and it's told me that the big problem is that the environment variable that's driving that configuration needed to be changed and then restart the server so I just said well can you make it so this happens automatically and so it just built a restart server based on the environment variable changing and as soon as I hit save it just started working again but the next question is what happens to the files so this is the this is the previous recording it's stored in this is the first segment of the recording now it's just stored as an ecam recording with a date time stamp and where it needs to be is over in this video project folder under the recordings directory and it should be named 1-1-intro so we'll come back to the application and we'll put in a one and we'll leave it with intro and and we can see what file name it's going to be let's click rename and see what happens it says renamed to that's really cool because I think it's worked click on the file yeah that's the same file now renamed at the target location now what I'm going to do now is stop this segment of the video and what we should see is a new video pop up here just with the date time stamp so I'll hit stop And I'm restarting and we can see that the video has been put into place here And so we can go back to our web application and unfortunately I have to type it each time This is something I wanted to auto calculate so it missed one aspect of the requirements But we'll put in the O1 this time. We'll put in 2. We are well We're not actually in the intro. We're in the demonstration. So I might call this demonstration instead and When we hit the rename button, we're expecting this video here To move to this location and it should just fit underneath. So let's hit rename and see what happens and it looks like it's created it and because This video was named wrong. I'm just going to go and rename it manually and this is the problem I'm trying to fix and this highlights the issue. I used to have where I had to manually keep changing days myself and we'll just be sure there's nothing in the Ecamm directory and it's only got the And it's only got the trailer And we'll just be sure it's been removed from Ecamm so we'll click over there and we've just got the original video that's always in that folder and Now I'll just stop the video and we should see it pop into the Ecamm live the recording that we're on right now and there's the recording in Ecamm and we're already configured. Now one of the reasons I like to put these names, now one of the reasons I like to have the names there is that this is how I build my chapters and I use large language models to read the transcript and read the file names to figure out what a good chapter heading should be. So we'll make our last manual change this is 013 and we will call it intro and it's filtered in and as we hit the rename and have a look at the recordings folder we can see that I made a mistake it should have been demonstration and this is really highlighting why we need to build in a little bit of automation so it just remembers the name each time and automatically increments the sequence as we go. So I'll finish this part of the video and it will be number four segment when I hit stop and then the next stage we'll move into doing a little bit of refactoring. Now I've encountered my first either bug or at least missing the complete implementation. So the first thing that we notice is that we've got the four videos that we've recorded so far. If we go over to the ecamm directory I've created two false starts and we can see them. Now my expectation is that if I deleted one of these files it should delete, it should get removed from here. That hasn't happened. The other thing that I'm expecting is that if I come down here to the other file and press discard it should remove. Now I'll remove this one so that we can see it and the one that I want to remove which should affect the actual file here is this value. So we press discard and it says removed from list but we don't see it actually removed. So we've got two little issues to resolve. So to fix the actual bugs and also add a couple of new functional requirements what I've done is I've read in the original Neymar proof of concept file that built this application I've seen what it's got I can see that part of the issue is that it hasn't finished off this area autosuggest but what I've done is created a file called fr which is for the functional requirements but what I've done is created a file called recording Neymar functional requirements and if we go and have a look at them what I've done is using story notation I've said what the bugs are so as a content creator if I manually remove an ecamm live video from the hard drive I just want it to be removed from the web interface from the incoming files or if I do it from the web interface I actually want it to be moved into a trash directory now I've done it as both bugs and some new functional requirements and what I'll do is save this file and I've just put in this little prompt that says can we move the functional requirements there are only five of them into the original Neymar proof of concept application and I just need it to blend in cleanly so you can see there that it's put some IDs into it so we'll just say can you implement and the great thing is it just breaks it up into tasks and we keep going we should be checking that we are still on the right model it should be Now we're about to do a test and you might have noticed something, the camera has changed around and this is one of the issues I have with video recording and one of the reasons why quite often I might have re-recorded the four videos that we've just seen because I have the camera in the wrong location. I'm not going to worry about it today but what we can see here is that I need to change the target video directory and the reason for that is I went and changed the main directory from Sonnet to Opus, I got the name wrong right at the beginning so what we'll do is we'll just come up here and we'll change this to Opus, that's what the video is going to be about. Now I'll hit save and I'm also going to keep the configuration and I'm also keeping the configuration reduced so that we can see more information here. The other thing I've done and this is a pretty normal part of my recording processes is that I've renumbered these because I realised that when I finished this video I want to talk about the scenario, that'll be chapter two and I want to talk about the intro, that'll be chapter one and so I've manually renamed this but this might be a capability I want to add into the tool later on anyway. But with that house cleaning out of the road let's go down to Ecamm Live where we've got this 53 video here and it's part of the refactor and we'll put it into chapter four to refactor and let's just do a rename and see what happens, it should disappear, it did and it should pop into the right location and rename, this is excellent. So let's look at one of the functional requirements I just added and that was as a content creator when I finish recording a video it comes into the incoming list and it should also automatically increment the sequence number. So we'll head over to the web application and we can see that there is a video currently sitting in the ecamm folder and the sequence number is 3 let's just check that 54 is the video that's correct and if we head over here we do want it to become number 3 so we'll come back to our tool and we'll just do a rename and hopefully we see a new video we do. Now the next test I want to do is around these two bugs that we had so I want to be able to delete videos of my hard drive and have the web interface automatically change also want to be able to delete it from the web interface and see the hard drive change So what I've done is just finished the recording we were just listening to and that's a long video it's 23 megabytes and then we've got two little short videos one is 2.8 and one is 2.6. Now I can already see a nice capability to add to the application and that would be a combination of the file size and also the transcript. The transcript would be really useful but the first thing we can do is just take the bigger video which is this one and do a simple rename. Now when we do the rename we should see a little toast message here and hopefully we're going to see this increment to five so we'll run that we've got a toast and that has incremented to five. Now we've got to get rid of files so we'll come down to our terminal and we will just pick one of them it doesn't really matter which one and we'll just delete it off the hard drive here it's gone and our web interfaces updated automatically so that's perfect. Now we've also got a discard button here and what we want to see is this file here just get removed so let's go and click discard and see whether that works that works as well. So that's awesome we've had three different capabilities that this one is just seeing the sequence number change and these were the two bugs and that was all the prompt was. This whole file was and that's all the prompt was this whole file was just loaded into the original proof concept here and we can see how it got merged in and let's see actually how long these five different and it would be interesting to see how long these five and it would be interesting to see how long these five functional requirements took to get generated by the new OPUS model and so I did a little question on the conversation just to how long it was and that was a three minute processing run so all up this has taken three minutes to fix five bugs we've only tested three of them so we're not so all up it's taken three minutes to implement two bugs one functional requirements there should be two others that we haven't tested yet we'll see whether they work but if you also want to see how long the entire application took we can just go Now we've got two more areas we can test. We can test this new chapter and we are about to go into the recap of the video. So this might be a good time to test that. We've also got this idea of what happens when we start a new video project. So let's work on that one first and I think the way we can test this is come up to the config and maybe just put in a different location. So what I'll do is I'll just rename this to fake and then we'll hit save and this is just updating the configuration and then I assume what we've got to do to clear everything out is just do a refresh and we do a refresh and it leaves it back at the beginning. So we're on chapter one, number one intro. So what we'll do is we'll just call this fake I think and another interesting test will be when I do save the video and I'm ready to rename it will it automatically create a folder here called capital F A K E will it create a folder here called fake. so the recording is in place no folder exists right now we'll just click on this rename and see if it works and it did now that's also interesting notice how it's saying little fake here and we've got capital fake here I think there's an issue with the way it I think there's an issue in the naming conventions going on here now it looks like it's worked correctly so we've got the fake file in the capital fake directory which is based on this value here I didn't need to create the directory it did it automatically now we've got the reverse of that test so there's a little file here and what we're about to do is I've removed the fake directory I've popped so what I've done is I've removed the fake directory and in recordings I've moved the fake and in recordings I've moved the fake recording to this location but we've still got one left what we'll do is we'll jump into here change it to recordings and hit save and at the moment this is incorrect I'm just want to see what happens if I do a refresh so I do a refresh and it just starts from scratch so we've got one slight little bug because it would be nice if it actually read the recordings directory and recalculated what it thinks is the next set of values so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to come back to so I think it's really easy to add that new capability I've just put in as a content creator I should be able to open an application pointed at a folder and have it recalculate the chapter ID the segment ID and the name so I've just added this here and with the last five items and with the last two bugs and three features taking three minutes to create we're just going to make sure that this new feature is added in I'm just saying now I've just asked it to update the renamer proof of concept application it's gone and renumbered a couple of files and it's added in this new functional requirement which is that it scans the directory on refresh let's go test that out so we'll come over to our application we are pointing at the recordings directory when we look at our folders my expectation is that the next number should be 04 number 8 so segment 8 and it should say refactor so let's do a refresh and here it comes and it didn't work and that's to be expected because I totally forgot to implement it so we'll just say can you implement so with a little task list coming up of what it's about to do building in a little model for checking suggested naming so it is only a suggestion it doesn't need to go with that but this is important when we first start up that it finds it out so it says it's done everything that we need I haven't really read this I'm just assuming it does because I'm pretty impressed with what Opus can do what we'll do is we'll come back to our system we can see that we're meant to be at 408 we can see that we're meant to be a chapter for segment 8 if I do a refresh we so what we'll do is a refresh and see if this works it hasn't worked and this is the first actual time that we've asked and this is the first time we've asked Opus to do something and it didn't work and I'm not sure why but it's usually a fairly easy fix because what we can do is just take context in this case all the information that's actually wrong because this should be chapter 4 number 8 because this should be chapter 4 segment 8 refactor we'll just head down to our screen and say so I've just put in a little prompt saying that what I was expecting was 8 because the last one was 7 and we'll just paste in the screenshot from before for context and we'll just paste in the screenshot before for context and what we'll do is we'll just run a refresh and see what happens and there we have it chapter 4 segment 8 name is refactor So I think we've finished testing the application and the refactor except for this last button called the new chapter and so now we're about to go into a recap. So what I'd like to do is just see what happens when we press this button we'll click on it and it says number five which is perfect segment one I really need to rename that to segment but we'll just call this a recap and so in the interest of recaps what do we have we have this little config button we can go and change the recordings it will automatically save it to the environment file now as well as also creating the directory if it doesn't exist if we were to hit refresh on a file without anything in it nothing following the naming conventions it would reset everything to one one intro we will also go into a new chapter in a moment called the outro that's where we're going to test some of these tags see what they do but for now I'll stop the recording So I'd finished the video and then forgot that I needed a recap stats like what have we talked about so let's just go and have a look at what we built today. Now it's called the Recording Namer proof of concept this is the development timeline and we can see that the initial Claude code and we can see that the initial Claude Opus 4.5 took 10 minutes and this built all the and this built all of the application while I went to bed the next day I got up we fixed a couple of bugs that took two minutes then I added a bunch of new features that you saw me do that's about three minutes of coding each time there were a couple of bugs so I had to do some bug fixing two minutes and then I had and then I added an auto detect files which was really just working out that if I started a new web session would it find the next file to create the stack is relatively complex we've got a server it's using Express 5 socket IO and other sorts of libraries we've got a client in react with Vite and Tailwind CSS information is being sent directly from my file system to the web using socket but when we need to query a little bit of information we're using tan stat query now information is sent directly from my file system to the web server using the socket IO and the application is in a mono repo with seven files for the server ten for the client and one file that shared between them both so everything was done without me actually looking at code it was just either asking it to follow the requirements updating the requirements and merging them in or just giving it the odd little you've got a bug here's some context go and fix it and as I start the recording you can see it's popped in a new file that we just recorded so what we'll do is we'll just hit rename and we can see that that new video has come in here 051 recap so the next thing let's just get so now we can go into the outro so I'll hit new chapter and at this point what I would usually do is some sort of outro and at this point what I would record is some sort of and at this point what I do is record some sort of call to action so I'm at Dave if you are interested in learning a bit about context engineering then join my school community the link is in the description and what we'll do now is we'll just come down and change this and we're going to click on this little tag we'll press that and so now when it saves it it should be 061 outro call to action so there's a little bit of a tag for me in my video editing we'll save the video we're ready to hit rename so let's click and move over and we should see the new file jump into place. Now we're nearly finished so we've got one other tag that we could do and this will probably be the end card so we'll click on that right now I think we can get rid of the call to action and with that what we can do is close the video so I'm Appy Dave please like and subscribe and I'll see you in the next video you know in the future what I think I'm gonna do is have some sort of bloopers area but we've just done our outro so let's do our rename and it should kick in right here anyway don't forget please like and subscribe",
