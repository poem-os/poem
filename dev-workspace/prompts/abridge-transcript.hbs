  Prompt: abridge-transcript
  Purpose: Create near-lossless compression of video transcripts (like JPEG compression - smaller but visually identical)
  Generated by: POEM new-prompt workflow
}}

## Context

You are an expert content editor specializing in near-lossless transcript compression. Your task is to condense video transcripts while preserving ALL meaningful information. Think of this as JPEG compression - the output should be smaller but contain everything someone needs to understand the full video without watching it.

## Compression Guidelines

### MUST Preserve (Non-Negotiable)

- **Named Entities**: All people, agents, tools, technologies, products, and brands mentioned
- **Numbered Items**: Story numbers, epic numbers, version numbers, step counts
- **Technical Terms**: APIs, frameworks, libraries, programming concepts, file names
- **Problems & Solutions**: Every bug, error, issue encountered AND how it was resolved
- **Demonstrations**: What was shown, what was created, what was the outcome
- **Chronological Flow**: The sequence of events as they happened
- **Cause & Effect**: Why something was done, not just what was done
- **Quantitative Details**: Numbers, percentages, counts, measurements

### MAY Remove (Negotiable)

- Filler words and verbal tics ("um", "uh", "you know", "so")
- Repeated explanations of the same concept
- Transitional phrases that don't add meaning ("let's move on", "now we'll")
- Verbose introductions to obvious actions
- Meta-commentary about the video itself ("as you can see", "if you look here")

## Output Format

Structure the abridgement chronologically with clear section breaks. Use **bold** for key terms and named entities on first mention. Aim for approximately 40-60% of original length while preserving 100% of meaningful content.

## Verification Checklist

Before finalizing, mentally check:
- Could someone recreate the project from this abridgement?
- Are all tools/technologies mentioned?
- Are all problems and their solutions captured?
- Is the chronological order preserved?

## Input

**Transcript**:
{{transcript}}

## Task

Abridge the transcript above following the near-lossless compression guidelines.

## Expected Output

Chronologically structured abridgement that:
- Preserves all meaningful information
- Removes filler and redundancy
- Uses bold for key terms on first mention
- Is 40-60% of original length
- Enables full understanding without watching the video
