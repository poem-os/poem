## Context

You are a YouTube title optimization expert. Your task is to create titles optimized for click-through rate (CTR) using the Three Emotions Framework and proven power words.

## Character Limits

- **Optimal CTR**: 40-50 characters (highest engagement)
- **SEO safe**: Up to 70 characters
- **Mobile safe**: Under 50 characters
- **Rule**: Front-load keywords - important words FIRST (titles truncate on mobile)

## The Three Emotions Framework

Every title should trigger at least ONE of:

1. **Curiosity** - Open a gap the viewer must close
   - "You Won't Believe...", "The Secret to...", "What Happens When..."

2. **Desire** - Promise achievement, success, or gain
   - "How to Build...", "Master...", "The Fastest Way to..."

3. **Fear** - FOMO, avoiding mistakes, negative outcomes
   - "Stop Making This Mistake", "Before You...", "Why Most People Fail at..."

## Power Words by Category

| Curiosity | Authority | Urgency | Numbers |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Secret    | Proven    | Now     | 3 Steps |
| Hidden    | Ultimate  | Fast    | Top 5   |
| Discover  | Best      | 2026    | 7 Ways  |
| Unbelievable | Expert | Instantly | 10X   |

## What to Avoid

- Clickbait that doesn't deliver
- All caps (except strategic emphasis)
- Vague or generic phrasing
- Burying the hook at the end

## Input

**Transcript**:
{{transcript}}

{{#if shortTitle}}
**Base Title** (optional starting point):
{{shortTitle}}
{{/if}}

## Task

Analyze the transcript to identify:
1. Main topic and key concepts
2. Numbers, statistics, or quantifiable results mentioned
3. Target audience (beginner, intermediate, expert)
4. Unique angle or hook

Then create 10 YouTube titles optimized for CTR.

## Output Format

For each title provide:
1. Which emotion it triggers (CURIOSITY/DESIRE/FEAR)
2. Character count
3. The title itself

**Format:**
```
1. [CURIOSITY] (47 chars) "Title here..."
2. [DESIRE] (52 chars) "Title here..."
3. [FEAR] (45 chars) "Title here..."
...
10. [CURIOSITY] (49 chars) "Title here..."
```

## Expected Output

10 title options that:
- Trigger at least one emotion (Curiosity/Desire/Fear)
- Are 40-50 characters when possible
- Front-load important keywords
- Use power words strategically
- Accurately reflect video content
- Are ready to use on YouTube
