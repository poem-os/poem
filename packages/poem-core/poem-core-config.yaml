# POEM Core Configuration
#
# ============================================================================
# SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR WORKSPACE PATHS
# ============================================================================
#
# This configuration file defines where user-generated content is stored.
# Workflows should NOT duplicate these paths - they inherit from here.
#
# Path Resolution Modes:
# - Development (POEM_DEV=true): Uses dev-workspace/ at monorepo root
# - Production (POEM_DEV not set): Uses poem/ in user's project root
#
# The config service (packages/poem-app/src/services/config/poem-config.ts)
# reads these paths and provides the resolvePath() API for all components.
# ============================================================================

# Workspace directories - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
# These paths are read by the config service.
# Workflows should NOT duplicate these - they inherit from config.
workspace:
  # Handlebars prompt templates (.hbs files)
  prompts: dev-workspace/prompts
  # JSON schema definitions for prompts
  schemas: dev-workspace/schemas
  # Generated mock data for testing
  mockData: dev-workspace/mock-data
  # User configuration files (providers, settings)
  config: dev-workspace/config
  # Persisted workflow execution state
  workflowData: dev-workspace/workflow-data

# Production workspace paths (for reference - applied by config service)
# When POEM_DEV is not set, the config service uses these defaults:
#   prompts: poem/prompts
#   schemas: poem/schemas
#   mockData: poem/mock-data
#   config: poem/config
#   workflowData: poem/workflow-data
