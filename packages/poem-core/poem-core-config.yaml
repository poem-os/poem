# POEM Core Configuration
# Workspace path configuration for prompt templates, schemas, and data
#
# This file is separate from .bmad-core/core-config.yaml which handles
# BMAD agent/story configuration. This file handles POEM-specific paths.
#
# Path Resolution:
# - Development (POEM_DEV=true): Paths relative to monorepo root (poem-os/poem/)
# - Production: Paths relative to user's project root

# Workspace directories
# In development, these are at the monorepo root level
# In production, these are prefixed with poem/ (created by installer)
workspace:
  # Handlebars prompt templates (.hbs files)
  prompts: prompts
  # JSON schema definitions for prompts
  schemas: schemas
  # Generated mock data for testing
  mockData: mock-data
  # User configuration files (providers, settings)
  config: config
  # Persisted workflow execution state
  workflowData: workflow-data

# Production workspace paths (used when POEM_DEV is not set)
# These are relative to the user's project root after installation
# Note: The config service applies 'poem/' prefix automatically in production mode
# when using fallback defaults. This section is for documentation purposes.
# productionWorkspace:
#   prompts: poem/prompts
#   schemas: poem/schemas
#   mockData: poem/mock-data
#   config: poem/config
#   workflowData: poem/workflow-data
